595c91d00000ff000aab8ec2,Christine Anderson,GB,17,1,Missing parcels temu refund to do anything about it,"After meeting a number of complaints to this company regarding my missing parcels, they're still refusing to do anything about it. Now I'm at the point I'm getting in touch with citizens advice to contact trade-in standards as a consumer act. Law says they are responsible to refund or reshare but they will not do anything at all about it. This has become an joke now I am sick of contacting them. All they do is open a ticket and then close it again. I have photographic evidence to prove I haven't got the parcel. Still refusing to do anything about it. How is this company still allowed to trade? All it does is rip people off all the time They're not interested in looking into anything. They just send generic messaging So tell you before you do your generic reply. I have contacted customer service but number of times and I'm talking in the high numbers and they still are refusing to do anything about it. So I am going to take this further. More people should be doing this and instead of letting this company carry on trading and taking people's money and not supplying itemsTemu as I said I have a lot of times you don't want to know. So your message you've just sent me is a load of rubbish a complete lie",2025-07-07T06:02:12.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us. We are sorry for any inconvenience caused.

They breach Australian Consumer Laws with advertising standards by listing the same product after deleting the other one with negative reviews so to hide their garbage they are trying to sell. This didn't just happen on 1 item, it was several all of a sudden removed from sale but still listed on other listing's as available.

The cost was substantially more than the original orders and one of the items was no longer available.I have written numerous times to their Help team who are either unable to understand or, more likely, cannot be bothered to look into it.

After completing the procedure and creating a profile, I never received the promised product or any credible explanation from the support.I later placed a regular order, but upon delivery one of the items was missing. I provided video evidence to prove that the contents of the package were incomplete, but the only response I received was that ""the item has been shipped"", without further checks or solutions.I find the customer service inadequate and the management of issues inefficient. I have reported the case to the European Commission - Directorate General for Justice and Consumers. In the absence of concrete answers, I will consider filing a petition to the European Parliament on the advertising and commercial practices of the company.Unfortunately, based on my personal experience, I cannot recommend Temu.Honest advice based on my experience:""If you know the danger, you avoid it.""I have contacted the Temu legal office by email and I am waiting for their response with the sending of the Xiaomi 14 as a gift and the sending of what I ordered that I have not received.i found email of legale office temy in the section ""Company data - Legal information"" on them web site.i please, beg and implore them to answer me.",2025-07-05T16:40:30.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

Endless correspondence were demanded that I explained my problems and show evidence to clarify the issue. It was as if we were speaking a different language which they are incapable of explicit meaning.

The reimbursement system suffers daily glitch upon check out, customer service behaves like they dont know what you are talking about and the endless nighmare goes on.Below is a rhetorical parrot like refrain in response to my complaint. I counted that they sent me 14 similar cut and paste messages. Temu staff are even unable to respond personally and for any complaints you give they respond with insincere diatribe.

5d431b8839d16b9b8897da62,Happy Customer,US,14,4,TEMU is a double-edged sword. Buyer beware!,"TEMU is a double-edged sword. They have provided me with online access to many products at great prices. I am moving to a new home. I have purchased most of what I need from TEMU. Rugs, furniture, light fixtures, wallpaper, shelves, home decor, bedding and kitchen items. I also buy printer ink, cleaning supplies, jewelry, exercise equipment, clothing, office supplies etc...and gifts for friends and family. TEMU never denies my refund requests, they have a 90-day return policy, pay for return shipping, and give me a $5 credit if a package takes longer than stated. They give me an immediate credit as soon as I request a refund. Many times they give me the refund credit and tell me to keep the product. I have never had to file a transaction dispute with TEMU. They are always polite and responsive. Their product instructions are hilarious. I save at least 50% on so many products.BUT BUYER BE BEWARE. Most importantly, DO NOT EVER download their app to your phone. I haven't and I have never had a security problem. I have been purchasing from TEMU for years and I just don't have problems. If you download their app, they may attempt to steal your financial data and many times they are successful. I don't know how it is done but my son studied them in his Cybersecurity class. They stole money from my uncle. A lot! When shopping, be smart, check product reviews, product details, product dimensions, look at all pictures of the product, read between the lines, and double-check prices. Many times, products are much smaller than they appear. Other times, you may think you are buying a product but you are buying a picture of the product. Really, a picture. If a vendor does sneaky stuff, return the product for a refund and don't buy from that vendor again. If you report the vendor to TEMU they will address the issue with the vendor. I know it sounds like I am justifying using TEMU. I am. To clarify...I always have a positive experience buying from Temu. I've included for you above why I feel this way. I haven't had such a positive experience when buying from other sites. I have never had any security issues with Temu. I will continue to buy from Temu. I will take steps to stay secure when buying from any online vendor.",2025-07-05T17:02:52.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us. We are sorry for any inconvenience caused.

Worn down with receiving the ad every few minutes when online I gave way & downloaded the ap. I then found to get the tablet/computer there was a minimum ¬£50 spend which incredibly I did. I was promised a number of gifts including the tablet but found I could only claim them daily & guess what- the tablet was the last item. One of the prizes mysteriously changed from what I had chosen a second was unavailable & the tablet now showing as ""Invalid repick"" & no tablet on offer to repick though they are if you want to now pay for one!! Evidence in screenshot as I have gone along Temu. Small print I see now says some gifts may not be available! Well lesson learned- nothing in life is free & if its too good an offer its likely too good to be true. If and when my actual ordered items come (delivery seems to take 2 weeks) they will be going back & the ap deleted.If I keep getting bombarded with ads of wailing girls being reassured its not a con then I will take further action-trading standards.PLEASE BE WARY PEOPLE",2025-07-04T07:59:16.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for participating in our promotional activities and we are sorry that you are experiencing difficulties with your rewards.

653f88323ee5a2001174c4bd,SARAH-JANE JARVIS,GB,5,1,Total scam,I've never been so disappointed in a company! The items for sale look good online but are of the worst quality. You could find better quality goods in the ¬£1 shop. Customer service is appalling. You wait weeks to receive the items only to find them made of terrible materials or be totally different to the description. Then you have to package them back up and send back to be inspected before a refund is issued. If they aren't in the correct pack with the barcode attached (most don't even have this when they arrive with you) then the refund isn't issued. This company is a scam. Don't waste your money or time. The offers may look appealing but trust me they aren't real. They say something is worth ¬£30 when in fact it's barely worth ¬£5 then dazzle you with massive discounts. Also don't use this company if you're disabled and have issues leaving your home and don't live near an Evri parcel stop because that is the only way they accept returns and they absolutely will not arrange a collection!,2025-07-03T22:26:37.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

536d4b03000064000172ac7d,George,US,2,1,Don't trust their advertising or customer service.,"I have been a TEMU customer for a handful of years. They have been good about shipping products, replacing the occasional missing item without too much difficulty... However, I have often been dissatisfied with product quality, and a constant bait and switch paradigm. The ads I receive from them are rarely legitimate: the links don't bring you to the advertised product, or, when they do for clothing, the advertised price is only good for one size, or one clearly unpopular color, or, the price is only good if you buy many more dollars of merchandise. I spent 50 minutes with online customer service today. They said the offer I received was only good for 24 hours, and the date of the offer was a day last week, even though I received the offer at 2:11 Eastern time today. My customer service rep was quite polite, but steadfastly declined to honor the offer I received... or give me to a supervisor, or contact information for one... or a name and mailing address for the CEO... I did later today receive a polite 'Sorry you were unhappy, but we are following our procedures' type of email reply. In fairness to them, I have been quite pleased with about 40% of the products I have ordered from them... the other 60% have mostly been 'as shown' but far less serviceable than expected. I am a camping enthusiast: I will say I have always been happy with their titanium products.They replied here to my complaint. I spent another 2-hours-ish answering several emails and on chat with them. Then I sent them the EMAIL offer they sent me... They asserted that I couldn't possibly have received the email I did, that I misquoted the offer, and said that I didn't respond to the (other) offer in time so, SOL. Here are some of their responses:Dear Valued Customer,This is a follow-up email in regards with your concern.Upon further review, based on the photo you provided, the item in this photo does not match to the item reward on the event ""Discount on One Cart Item"". The item associated with the event is ""New Winter Warm Women's Snow Boots with Side Zipper"".

I fell down the TEMU rabbit hole. At first, received items, MUCH smaller than expected. But I can work around that. Lesson learned. Then, after so many orders, they started showering me with coupons, after qualifying purchases, of course. Here's where they getcha. One receives the incorrect item, or doesn't receive anything at all. Vendor, doesn't respond. And TEMU's response is to offer another coupon, not a great coupon that one just used. Yep. One has to buy even more. Coupons are not credited back to one's account. Items are not replaced. It goes on & on, 'til one, me, finally realizes that they're paying for ads/pictures only, of the items one wants.FYI both Amazon and Walmart, offer the same or similar. One, caveat, slightly more expensive. But, here's the kicker, one actually RECEIVES the item. Shocker.

But be cautious when buying anything that requires accurate sizing like clothing. If they do not have your size in stock, they may just send a smaller one. They also claim their sizes match UK sizing, which is completely untrue.I ordered four XL shirts. None of them were actually XL. One was clearly a small, and it felt like they just put an XL sticker on the bag. Based on other reviews, I am not even bothering to return them. I have already thrown them in the bin. The same thing happened when I ordered trousers.Also worth noting, the material is very thin whether it is trousers or shirts, and definitely not suitable for UK weather.

That's not all. I was notified that I could get the other items for free (one at a time at every purchase) but when I added stuff to my basket and went to checkout it wasn't there.

5d1500c0a9030cf1dc29cdb6,Tray,US,7,1,This seller Hong Hu Hardware and‚Ä¶,"This seller Hong Hu Hardware and Plumbing in TEMU is THE ABSOLUTE WORST, TEMU'S CUSTOMER SERVICE IS ALSO HORRIBLE AT THIS POINT.Long story short: FedEx claimed to have delivered my package on 6/18. However they did not, I even have a video camera that proves there was no FedEx activity at my door during time of alleged delivery or at all that day. So I called FedEx, FedEx verified with me that the package was not delivered to my address as it was supposed to, but instead delivered to a FedEx location, reason as told to me by FedEx, is the drivers are allowed to do that when it's economy shipping basically they can handle your delivery anyway they want, mark it delivered but not even bring where its supposed to go. So its obvious, the package was not delivered to me. I contacted seller and Temu customer service because both are telling me to contact the other, I explain to them what FedEx has told me. And since FedEx did not deliver to my apartment like they were supposed to, there was no way I was going to go pick it up from them. Temu says to contact the seller, I did with proof from my video camera footage showing no FedEx activity during that time or day, shipper says give them 1-2 days to make a decision. They deny my refund saying to contact Temu, I contacted Temu with the same proof, Temu says, it would take 2-4 days and says they see i already have a refund claim and to contact the seller yet again. I contacted the seller again with my refund claim. Did I mention since they are the shipper they are indeed privy to the same FedEx information or even more detailed info than me. But I guess that makes too much sense for them to be reasonable enough to verify on their own as well. Anyway, I come back showing actual proof from FedEx saying at the very top of the tracking page ""This package is being returned since we're unable to deliver it"", right below it in with a BIG RED mark from FedEx says: RETURNING TO SHIPPER. FedEx clearly stated on tracking page they were unable to deliver it, how is that not proof that it was never delivered to my apartment like it was supposed to, how is the RETURNING TO SENDER, not proof as well. I sent both seller and Temu proof. Seller still denied my refund and said contact Temu, I contacted TEMU AGAIN AND AGAIN with the same proof I gave to seller. TEMU replies back ""We will verify the delivery status with the seller as soon as possible, and the expected verification time is 72 hours. Once there are any updates, we will inform you immediately"" - ARE THEY SERIOUS!!!!!!!! WHAT MORE PROOF CAN BE MORE VIABLE THAN THE ACTUAL PROOF FROM THE FEDEX TRACKING PAGE SAYING IT COULD NOT BE DELIVERED, RETURNING TO SENDER!!!!!! THIS HAS BEEN GOING ONE FOR 2 WEEKS NOW.

551bfd7a0000ff0001b57a55,Robert Duirs,GB,158,1,"No receipts or confirmation of orders,","This appears to be a shocking money-grabbing dishonourable and altogether dishonest company. Stuff fails to arrive, although paid for; the stuff that does arrive is not as described and they fail to respond to emails of complaints. They seem to be associated with scamming sites such as stylishoes, sadly. Very sneakily, they make use of unreliable suppliers who fail to provide any confirmation of orders that have been placed or any invoices. Their associate so-called suppliers namely Stylishoe are involved in disgusting and possibly criminal activities. As a company of apparent con-artists they supplied 5 pairs of shoes all of which are the wrong size (a centimetre too short and with no size labels). One pair of slippers never arrived at all. Also none of the shoes were wide-fitting as advertised (that being precisely why we ordered them) Every single complaint to the suppliers was ignored. When I opened and tried on the jumper that I‚Äôd ordered from them, it was impossible to even get my arm into it: so I checked the label to see if a mistake could have occurred, I discovered that what had been sent was a second-hand extremely small jumper with the label cut off. These suppliers and associates for Temu appear to be a company of fraudsters and active con-artists. Perhaps some Chinese and HongKong based companies are trustworthy but that is surely not one of them, sadly. This company in sending the rubbish products of Stylishoe dub themselves as the ‚Äúretailer‚Äô‚Äô : all part of the same con-artistry I presume‚Ä¶ Temu must obviously take full responsibility for their agents and suppliers, not hide behind them as appears to be the case.",2025-07-03T09:16:27.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for shopping on Temu!

63f3817e51fd8f00128223d6,KHs,GB,6,1,how many Temu customer advisors does it take?,"after chatting online with various members of Temu customer services over a period of 2 days and getting absolutely nowhere I requested to have it escalated. Twice it was supposedly 'escalated' to the ridiculously called 'Customer Resolution Senior Specialist' who looks into the issue and responds by email. The irritating part of this is that the 'specialist' sends a scripted email giving the instruction of what to do in the order process - this would be funny if I hadnt spent 2 hours during each online chat waiting in between my issue and their scripted pointless responses!!!I dont have a resolution as the 'specialists' just close the ticket when they send their scripted irrelevant email.Trying to get a simple answer as a consumer is impossible with Temu - no wonder they are being investigated by the European Consumer Councils!But, a positive amongst the gloom, I did chat with 'Malik' just now who was the one and only customer advisor who offered an intelligent possible answer to my issue!So, I hope you are all lucky enough to get Malik on the Temu chat line!UPDATE - response from temu added below! Sorry I do not have another 2 hours to give today in 'chat line'.In wanting to purchase the utility art knife pen set with cutting nibs the size of pen nibs, they still fall under the 'age verification' law. A box pops up to fill with all personal details.When asking how the details were checked, it took several attempts on the 'chat' over 2 days with waiting for responses making each up to 2 hours long - and with responses varying -We dont have that information;We cant give that information; Temu does;A third party;I asked who was the 'third party'? and was challenged as to who told me it was a third party!Like the majority of people, I care where my info is going, so persisted:II have to state again that Temu's Customer Resolution Senior Specialists are absolutely pointless as they ignore anything you are asking about and just send a standard pre-written email that has no connection!Finally I got through to Malik who did not consistently send me pre-written scripts that had no connection to what I was asking and he suggested it would probably be my payment organisation....the first Temu customer advisor who was able to think outside the pre-written responses!Checking on Amazon, they have the answer to my question already printed in the 'age verification' info.And - FYI - to get a credit card a person must be 18 and over; to have a paypal account a person must be 18 and over; to GET A TEMU ACCOUNT a person must be 18 and over.........",2025-07-01T08:24:49.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

6860447a8a537581217fcc7b,Martin,CR,1,1,Problem(a) Temu Aeropost Costa Rica,"3-7-25 After my relentless scrambling to save the situation, Temu has simply indicated they will reimburse me so I will follow up with a more pointed review shortly27-6-25 (Espa√±ol a continuaci√≥n) The chances are that you too will be taken advantage of by sleazy tricks. There is a multitude of systemic problems with Temu and Aeropost, their local delivery service in Costa Rica but on this particular situation, dishonesty is the reason my package was not delivered, no attempt was even made and the local delivery service lied about making an attempt and then promising to try another time. I provided evidence they did not follow protocol and because they couldn't refute it, they used up time pretending they were working on it Aeropost saying they are preparing to bring the package and Temu saying they couldn't locate the package (which is also evidence of intent). So after they let the time expire, they send me a message the case is now closed, they found the package and i can go pick it up (at a location 5hrs away!). It is hard to convey systemic dishonesty but sometimes it is possible. This story goes much deeper as it involves Aeropost who flat out threatened, lied and Temu just pretended and promised to find and deliver the package but that too was misdirection. What they do is just a cascade of cut and paste ""dear customer, we have been trying to locate your package..."" I doubt anything is being done and this is just the standard Kabuki. If this was court, by breaking down each step, I could demonstrate how both Temu and Aeropost refused to assume responsibility for their failure of one maybe several employees and instead punished me to save money and effortLo m√°s probable es que a usted tambi√©n se aprovechen de usted con trucos turbios. Hay una multitud de problemas sist√©micos con Temu y Aeropost, su servicio de entrega local en Costa Rica, pero en este caso particular, la deshonestidad es la raz√≥n por la que mi paquete no fue entregado; ni siquiera lo intentaron y el servicio de entrega local minti√≥ sobre intentarlo y luego prometi√≥ volver a intentarlo. Present√© pruebas de que no siguieron el protocolo y, como no pudieron refutarlo, perdieron el tiempo fingiendo que estaban trabajando en ello: Aeropost dijo que se preparaban para traer el paquete y Temu dijo que no lo pudieron encontrar (lo cual tambi√©n es evidencia de intenci√≥n). Entonces, despu√©s de que se cumpliera el tiempo, me enviaron un mensaje diciendo que el caso estaba cerrado, que encontraron el paquete y que pod√≠a ir a recogerlo (¬°a 5 horas de distancia!). Es dif√≠cil transmitir deshonestidad sist√©mica, pero a veces es posible. Esta historia es mucho m√°s profunda, ya que involucra a Aeropost, quien amenaz√≥ y minti√≥ abiertamente, y Temu simplemente fingi√≥ y prometi√≥ encontrar y entregar el paquete, pero eso tambi√©n fue una distracci√≥n. Lo que hacen es una cascada de copias y pegas: ""Estimado cliente, hemos estado intentando localizar su paquete..."". Dudo que est√©n haciendo algo, y esto es simplemente el t√≠pico Kabuki. Si esto fuera un tribunal, al desglosar cada paso, podr√≠a demostrar c√≥mo tanto Temu como Aeropost se negaron a asumir la responsabilidad por el incumplimiento de uno o varios empleados y, en cambio, me castigaron para ahorrar dinero y esfuerzo.",2025-07-03T16:07:13.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

I contacted Temu several times, they don't respond. On their website they advise one should contact the courier - that's how far their 'help' goes. This was the second parcel that did not arrive, and where Temu just ignored the problem. Tracking Number:H0483A1265870020, non-delivery on May 15. Again, the photo showed parcels out in the street where there is heavy footfall, and NOT in front of my apartment door.

65956421cabbd00012097aa7,FIONA BELL,GB,4,5,Prompt delivery by royal mail,So far I've made one order and I believe it was delivered by royal mail. It promptly arrived and the guy was able to get into my apartment building. So I was a very satisfied customer. This is because royal mail is given a special code to enter the building since they deliver all the post ie letters to homes. The guy was able to enter the building and he came to my apartment door. Royal mail have a procedure that if they deliver large packages and the person is not at home they will take it back to their depot and try 3 more times. As a courier they are very reliable and trustworthy.I have just placed another order yesterday 27th June. It shows on the tracking system that Evri will be the courier which I'm wary of. They have the reputation of going to the wrong addresses and taking photos to show that they have dropped it off as proof of delivery but in a lot of cases they have gone to the wrong address. With regards to an apartment building it becomes more complicated. They have the option of ringing the apartment number on the intercom at the main entrance door to gain access to the building. But in my one experience of Evri they didn't do that even though I made sure I was at home at the time the tracking system had given. With my latest order from Temu I hope the delivery goes right.

I‚Äôve been recovering from a car accident, in pain and unable to get around ‚Äî and Temu‚Äôs delivery partner (Yodel) has caused me nothing but distress and anxiety.I stayed home all week waiting for my parcel. I live in a top-floor flat and clearly stated that the top buzzer must be used ‚Äî it‚Äôs the only way I can know someone‚Äôs at the door. Despite being reassured that the driver would follow these instructions, they weren‚Äôt.Yodel then claimed they‚Äôd attempted delivery three times, but they hadn‚Äôt. No buzzer pressed. No chance for me to answer the door. Just an assumption that I wasn‚Äôt in ‚Äî which is false and deeply frustrating.I contacted support, explained my limited mobility, and asked for help. Instead, I was told to travel to collect the parcel from a depot ‚Äî something I physically cannot do. I was left in tears, feeling ignored, powerless, and honestly ashamed for needing support.It‚Äôs not just poor service ‚Äî it‚Äôs a complete lack of care for vulnerable and disabled people. What‚Äôs even worse is how easily this could have been avoided by simply listening and following basic delivery instructions.I never expected to feel this dismissed and excluded as a customer. This experience wasn‚Äôt just inconvenient ‚Äî it was emotionally exhausting.I don‚Äôt say this lightly: if you‚Äôre vulnerable, disabled, or rely on simple accessibility being respected ‚Äî please think twice before ordering.",2025-06-27T13:12:15.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

5fd773327669c700195b54fa,Tracey Officer,GB,34,1,Been trying to contact customer‚Ä¶,"Been trying to contact customer services all day and still nothing. Apparently busy what a load of BS. Nobody has to wait in a q everytime U go on there normally. Now they just don't want to answer. Pathetic. They send a voucher for ¬£5 off a ¬£50 order lmfao why on earth would I place an order when I'm waiting for a refund on a replacement garden ornament that was smashed. Into the 8th week as they put it on a land delivery. Had a smashed cup they wanted me to send it back ü§£ü§£ sorry but that's dangerous, I'll take the hit. Trainers are always too small even when they do manage to send the right size. I have 4 pairs of trainers and a pair of sandals they sent the wrong size for, blatantly, I did get a refund without sending back as I refused a partial refund, ¬£1.78 for shoes I can't wear. I received a dress today I've asked them to pick up but apparently they don't do that. I run my own business and really busy. So I'll end up keeping it. Alot of the tops are small fitting if you like to move in them. They say U get cash back on orders. What you don't realise it's over 5 dAys. They will not give you it in one go. Their discount offers are overpriced so U think U are getting 80%off. That's not true the price U think h are getting on offer is their normal price. Sometimes more expensive than what they have if U look at for it yourself. Everything is a con on here.. What I will not do is send back broken pot with sharp edges. Idiots think this is ok. It's not ill take the hit rather than risk someone's hands. Never think they are doing you a favour y sending vouchers to apologise for the long wait of their ultra slow deliveries. U have to spend ¬£100 to get a ¬£10 off ü§£ü§£ü§£ sorry not desperate just fed up of them taking the Mick. AVOID!!!!!",2025-06-27T03:10:22.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

61513173951d9e00128b6500,N rahal,NL,7,1,Unfortunately,"Unfortunately, my experience with Temu has been very disappointing. While the platform appears attractive with flashy deals and heavy discounts, most of these offers are misleading or downright deceptive. Coupons are advertised heavily, but once you make a purchase in hopes of redeeming them, you find out they come with hidden conditions and are rarely valid for quality products, electronics, or locally shipped items ‚Äî only for specific, low-demand items.I‚Äôve had several frustrating experiences: ‚Ä¢ Customer service responses are mostly generic and unhelpful, wasting both time and patience. ‚Ä¢ Some shipments sent by ground shipping took nearly two months to arrive. ‚Ä¢ Items have arrived in damaged or open boxes, giving the impression that they were previously used ‚Äî completely unacceptable if you plan to gift them or expect something new.The final straw was a recent order for a Nintendo Switch 2, priced at ‚Ç¨604. I paid an additional ‚Ç¨80 in customs fees in the Netherlands. When the product arrived, it turned out that it did not include the Mario Kart game (which was supposed to be part of the bundle and worth around ‚Ç¨80 on its own).I contacted support and submitted clear photo evidence. The only response I got was: ‚ÄúYou can return the item for a refund.‚ÄùAfter waiting nearly two months, paying customs, and being let down by the missing item, this solution was far from acceptable. By the time I returned the product, waited for a refund, and reordered a replacement, I‚Äôd be waiting another two months.Temu may look like a budget-friendly platform, but in my experience, it cost me more time, money, and energy than it was ever worth.",2025-06-26T23:26:37.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

Sure, you'll get your delivery, but the quality is complete garbage, the packaging is a bag so your stuff will be thrown and smashed when you get it.

5d0b521f1a53afe3d6dfe71b,John Barrett,GB,10,1,Scammers I think,Scammers I think. They had a promotion that was worded as such I thought I could get it by buying a few things. I believe I was informed I actually bought an item and met the requirements of getting so much gold coins for the event. The information disappeared from my account on the app after I bought it. I kept getting contradicting information from their AI and then the actual customer service person. I have screenshots. It turns out I had to pay equal to what the offer was according to the customer service adviser.. In this case buying ¬£200 in product to get ¬£200 credit. That's okay if you realise that but that's not what I interpreted from their wording that I think was designed to mislead and get people to buy and explain later why they didn't get the reward. I cancelled my order. I understand their things can be good value but this was an item I wasn't prepared to wait until August for delivery and not get the reward either. I want the item for the summer so I will need to buy elsewhere.,2025-06-25T04:49:33.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out, and we apologize that you are experiencing issues with our promotions.

Even creating a ticket doesn't help at all, it is actually just a waste of time. All they do is just robotic replies and spam my mails and messages in app/website. I used this online shopping website for quite a long time and spent soo much of my money on it, but in return what dk I get? Customer support's robotic replies, no helpful replies or solutions. They keep insisting on returning a 27kr worth item when it is not even my fault. Whenever I inquire about any item at all, all they do is give me a return for a refund option. Then the bot won't even let me talk to any real agent too. And this process keeps on repeating whenever I contact the customer support. So, this is more like a wake up call to me to stop wasting my time and money on it. And I will do just that! Not only that, they deceive through promotional offers and extort money.

I ordered a shed (PO-210-14660126710391339) that arrived with a number of parts missing, which was disappointing enough. But the real issue started when I tried to return it.The return label provided was totally inadequate for the size and weight of the item. I was only given a drop-off label, and since I don‚Äôt have a car and can‚Äôt carry such a large item on my own, I had to hire a man with a van to take it to the EVRI drop-off point. However, the package was refused at THREE different locations because of its size and weight ‚Äì apparently, none of the stores could handle it. Upon informing temu they could not provide another solution and told me to take photos‚Äùbe patient‚Äù and went on a tangent about how great their customer service is???Now, over a week has passed, and I‚Äôve been bouncing back and forth with customer service. I keep receiving nonsensical responses, such as being asked to take photos or to look at instructions ‚Äì which is laughable because there are no instructions! I can‚Äôt even open the package again because it took me forever to wrap it back up, and there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm going through that hassle again.So, essentially, Temu took my money, sent me an incomplete shed with no usable parts, and now they‚Äôre making it nearly impossible to return the item and get a refund.

Another example: the air fryer Temu sells for ‚Ç¨40, under the name Silver Cest you can find it in Macedonian stores for about ‚Ç¨20 to ‚Ç¨25!You buy sneakers or sandals that fall apart quickly and injure your feet.

The QR code was scanned and I was told I would receive a proof of drop off by email. I never received an email with the proof of drop off, so I contacted both Homerr and temu. Homerr was quite clear, something went wrong with the scan so the parcel was transported and stuck in their distribution centre. They explained me the procedure; I should contact the webshop who shipped the initial order, temu in this case, and that the webshop should open a claim through the Homerr website (as Homerr operates for temu). This procedure is also explained on their website. So, I contacted temu 6 times and explained the situation 6 times, and they have been absolutely useless! They keep on asking me for a proof of drop off, while the whole point is that I never received a proof because something went wrong with the scan!!! I even forwarded a screenshot of the reply I received from Homerr helpdesk, and still they do not contact Homerr to submit a claim. Instead of taking the case serious temu just closed my ticket! No follow up, no refund or whatsoever! Such a lousy temu helpdesk - they are totally unaware of the procedure to follow, or just lazy, ...

Temu is by far the most dishonest business I have dealt with in a while. The products are cheap as in price, but also in quality. I understand the get what you pay for. But the absolute lies they spew in advertising ""free this, or free that"" is utter nonsense. They even have the audacity to create advertising that points out exactly what will happen to you. You are NOT getting free anything. Case in point, tablet offer now. Sure, the $30 tablet will be free after you buy $300 worth of product. Just one example. They put time limits on free items (as I check out in X amount if time, they NEVER specify it or have a timer), the continue to distract you in their app so things might appear free until you realize they don't understand what FREE means. Keep buying more, we will give you this. It is never ending. Just avoid them OR get in, buy exactly the trinket or gadget you want, and get out.

A couple of hours ago, I added a couple of pieces of British bought wool that I KNOW is wool - it has virtually disappeared, whilst the rest remains as good as new!I must assume that it is some kind of acrylic!Some of the yarn says it's from Turkey, and the rest is apparently from China - it could be from space; these people do not tell the truth.",2025-06-18T21:25:47.000Z,,"Hello Marian, thank you for reaching out to us.

6851096b2f247804bb1fa4ac,Bhoomi Rachchh,AE,1,1,Items Returned but not Refunded,"I am honestly beyond frustrated and completely shocked at this point. Two items under Tracking No: JTE300299583146 were collected from my address on June 9, 2025, and now I receive a message from Temu saying the return can‚Äôt be processed because the items never reached you? Are you kidding me?The delivery agent picked up the package right from my doorstep. I‚Äôve attached photos showing the items were collected and delivered to your warehouse. So where did it disappear after that? That‚Äôs your responsibility‚Äînot mine. I did everything by the book: packed the items, waited for pickup, handed them over. And now? I‚Äôm sitting here without the products and without my refund.And this isn‚Äôt even the first time. Previously, I returned an item and never got the refund of AED 68. Now I‚Äôve lost AED 245.33 again for items that were picked up with confirmation. Don‚Äôt even try to come back with excuses like ‚Äúmaybe the item wasn‚Äôt packed properly‚Äù‚Äîbecause it was, and packed with 10 other items that were received just fine.All 12 items were picked up together. You received most, but somehow the ones with the higher value mysteriously vanished? That‚Äôs suspicious, and frankly unacceptable.So now let me be very clear:Total refund due = AED 68 + AED 245.33 = AED 313.33.I want this amount refunded immediately.To make things worse, there‚Äôs no proper customer support. No phone number, no working chat, no email ID‚Äîjust automated replies from an AI bot that‚Äôs absolutely useless when it comes to real issues like this. So now I‚Äôm writing to every Temu contact I can find, because I‚Äôm tired of being ignored.If I don‚Äôt receive a proper resolution and refund ASAP, I will escalate this further‚Äîpublicly. I will share my experience across every social media platform and consumer forum possible, because this is no way to treat a loyal customer. I‚Äôve been shopping regularly with Temu, and I did not expect this kind of behavior.I've attached full proof‚Äîpickup confirmation, package photos, item details. Now I expect a clear and immediate response:Where are my returned items?When will my AED 313.33 refund be processed?",2025-06-17T08:21:46.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

Temu Bietet nicht nur viel Ware an die Unbrauchbar und Schlecht Verarbeitet sind, man wird auch noch Bestohlen!Zum Beispiel, wenn nur noch ein Artikel √úbrig ist den man im Warenkorb hat, aber noch nicht Bezahlt hat, dann nimmt Temu den R√ºcksichtslos aus den Warenkorb Heraus und Verkauft ihn an Jemand Anderen.Was ist wenn ich Milch im Laden Kaufen m√∂chte und keine mehr da ist, und ich dann einen Liter aus dem Korb eines Anderen Eink√§ufer nehme, das sollte man auch nicht machen! Echt Bl√∂de Methoden bei Temu! Normalerweise k√∂nnte Jemand das als Kritisches / Kriminelles Verhalten von Temu Bezeichten! Ich sage nur, es ist falsch, anderen das wegnehmen, wonach derjenige Stundenlang auf Temu gesucht hat.So macht das Einkaufen / Bestellen bei Temu keinen Spa√ü!Vor allen Dingen hat man Schlie√ülich auch eini Zeit Lang am Computer Verbracht um die Korrekte Ware zu finden!Temu: Eicht Unversch√§mt und Total R√ºcksichtslos! Mir wurde Einfach der WLan Adapter aus dem Warenkorb genommen weil es der Letzte Artikel war. So zu sagen Ausverkauft! Extremely Bad Store/Site!Temu not only offers a lot of unusable and poorly made goods, you also get robbed!For example, if there's only one item left in your shopping cart that you haven't paid for yet, Temu will ruthlessly remove it from your cart and sell it to someone else.What if I want to buy milk in the store and there's none left, and then I take a liter from another shopper's basket? You shouldn't do that either!Temu's really stupid methods! One could consider that as critical/criminal behavior on Temu's part! I'm just saying, this is wrong, to take from others what you have searched for and for quite some time!This makes shopping/ordering at Temu no fun!Above all, you've spent quite a bit of time on the computer trying to find the right product!Temu: Absolutely outrageous and totally ruthless!The Wi-Fi adapter was simply removed from my shopping cart because it was the last item.

However, this is my third time using them, and each time they've delivered exactly what they advertised and promised‚Äîat great value. So far, it's been a great experience, and I haven't had any issues.That said, I do find their constant promotions and offers quite confusing and overwhelming. Everyone loves a good deal, but the way the discounts and promos are presented can make it difficult to understand what you're actually getting. For example, there's this ¬£170 cashback into your PayPal account, and I honestly don't know if that's real or not, so I‚Äôm unsure about it.Because of all the flashy deals, endless images, and seemingly unrealistic discounts, they can come across as a bit scammy. Some of the offers really do seem too good to be true‚Äîand maybe they are. But I just want to say that, for me, the experience so far has been really, really good. That‚Äôs not to say it won‚Äôt change, but up to now, I‚Äôve been very happy.",2025-06-15T15:41:36.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for shopping with us and sharing your 5-star experience!

I submitted a refund request, but was told I need to return the item first. Given the poor quality and useless nature of the product, I do not believe it is fair or reasonable to ask customers to spend additional time and resources to return such an item.I have already submitted a review on your platform describing the issue publicly. I expected better customer service and buyer protection from Temu.I kindly request that you process a full refund without requiring a return as an exception under your buyer satisfaction guarantee.If this request is not resolved, I will have no choice but to escalate the matter further and share my experience across public channels.Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.Best regards,PO-014-09106646028151129",2025-06-15T15:39:55.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

All of a sudden I was half way there, tried to report them for scamming me and said you need evidence,screenshot and everything but it literally was a split second then disappeared,as soon as my orders arrive I'll be sending back and deleting the app,should have gone to my temu credit which is on 0000000, I won't be ordering anything else there ever again.

They are extremely unsafe. They tried offering me $17 for a refund instead of the $266. I filed a return and they canceled it while I was sleeping and said I did it, at 2:41 am !!!!! Now they say I have to pay for the returns because I canceled the original one. They also will also give only one return label for 2 large boxes when each one is approx 75 lbs and there is 3 !!!. UPS won't take them so they cannot be returned. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY !!! I learned the hard way. They literally scammed me out of over $300. The shelves cannot be used because they will twist and fall on someone ! Temu doesn't care.Edit.

The product photos showed them going straight into ovens and microwaves. No warnings. No disclaimers. Just clean-looking metal trays that looked safe and trustworthy.But what I got was something else entirely.The trays are coated in invisible plastic. Not just inside. The entire tray is wrapped in a thin layer of clear plastic that you would never know is there. Not until it melts into your food.I melted butter in one tray. I baked cakes. I gave those cakes to people I love. The next morning, I found plastic peeling up from the inside like a skin.That‚Äôs when I realized I had unknowingly baked melted plastic into every bite.I scratched another tray and saw the plastic lift off the outside too. This is not stainless steel. This is a plastic-covered metal decoy sold as oven-safe cookware.The listing I bought from? Gone. Quietly deleted. No way to review it. No way to warn others. But now I see the same trays being sold under new listings with the same photos and the same lies.This is not an accident. This is a pattern. And it's dangerous.Temu is allowing sellers to push unsafe, falsely labeled kitchenware with no accountability. If I hadn‚Äôt caught the liner peeling up the next day, I never would have known.I have the photos. I have the regret.

Tracking number was issued 3 days ago but hasn't even reached the courier company yet.Although, temu offers items with attractive discounts, but there is a catch. It keeps bombarding custmer with offers as a must to get the item, you actually want to buy, with the discount. Example : I saw something for 3 to 4 British pounds (very good price) but the app wouldn't let me checkout unless I spend atleast ¬£15 on items temu had selected for me. Quality wise; it's not always good, depending on your luck u might get good quality or often u might not !! Plus delivery time is not ideal. Conclusion : one can get better quality with fair price and quicker delivery from other places without putting up with the annoying Temu app üòî. I can only say.... keep away, so you don't have to, like many others, go through the hassle of returning the items you bought.",2025-06-12T13:26:33.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

Temu is definitely not the dog's bullocks by any means. They sell you refurbished rebuilt reused products and call them brand new they sell you products that are built just so they will break in a relatively short amount of time or uses their customer service is 90% AI even when they say they're handing you over to a live agent that live agent just happens to be ai and at the very most it is a human being writing one paragraph followed by repeated messages written by AI and inserted by a human pushing a button their refunds they say they issue them they show you an refund issued receipt within arn number and tell you that you are supposed to contact your bank and get them to track it with this number and when you do so your bank tells you to tell them pretty much to stop effing around because they are full of shit and if there was a refund issued the refund would be in your bank and not lost somewhere in between in some imaginary digital playground taking a break before it gets to your bank account I have received one refund from these guys and they issued it the same day it hit my bank yet I am still waiting for refunds they say they've issued that are over a month old and they tell you that once it's been issued it's out of their hands and I have to contact my bank because it would be in their hands now which is not the way it works also not even legally they break the law they lie they cheat and they just don't give a crap they tell you they're going to give you something and then they say you have to buy shit first and then once you buy shit they tell you you have to buy more shit and then more shit and then more shit until your money runs out and you still haven't gotten a free gift that's going to break either before it gets to you or the first time you test it out anyway this site should be legally shut down how does as it is 100% a scam site even if they have a good front going for them just because something looks good doesn't mean it is just because something looks legal and has all the legal papers to prove it is legal doesn't mean that it is operated legally so save your phony good reviews and people out there who read reviews to base whether they'll spend their money on this place or not read them closely and if you see a five-star rating on this site know that it is probably someone that works at this place leaving a review and getting paid to do so it is the one star reviews you should start reading and then just keep reading until you get up to a five-star and notice how fake they start getting as you climb very horrible store very horrible products that is China's worst is of the worst being sold to the best of the best so that they can cheat us out of our money and then by our weapons to use against us it is the Chinese agenda after all steal the designs of our products build our products as cheap as humanly possible sell them back to us thinking we're getting a heck of a deal by buying something for a quarter the price you would over here not realizing that the materials used and the craftsmanship it was put together with or no more than paper mache and 2 month old babies temo should either be blown up with all its workers in it for having that kind of mindset or should be shut down by the proper authorities mind you the proper authorities are probably getting some kind of cut in this deal anyway because every government organization is a terrorist organization and the world should be ran by the people not by an organization,2025-06-11T20:43:51.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

The last straw was a request for payment for cloud storage that I never expected.Now when I try to complain to Yi Industries there are so many hoops and hurdles to overcome again you give up in frustration.The whole experience leaves a bad taste and puts me off every buying from Temu again.Order ID PO-069-05926559684472Ray Nipper.Slight change in as much as the seller Yi Technology has offered a 50% refund and no need to return goods. So accepting this offer but it is most unlikely I will ever use these cameras if I have to pay a monthly fee for cloud storage.So beware of this hurdle making it very difficult to avoid getting sucked into a regular payment you were not expecting.Plus more difficulties in trying to contact the seller about my problem. It was only two options to keep or return. Websites rarely make it easy to contact the sellers and create so many hurdles it's easy to just give up.Thanks for the 50% refund.,2025-06-12T08:39:52.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

5e97441d26eeac234b1b4c45,Alexander Smirnov,EE,5,5,Temu is great,"Temu is greatI got 41 parcels (210 items) from Temu in 17 months, ~1.2k euros. Price adjustment. A feature where you get some money back after it got cheaper during 30 days. For me it's usually around 5-10% cashback. Tracking always works. Makes you see how long customs are holding your parcel.Delivery is pretty fast (at least for me in EU), sometimes it is even faster than earliest estimate. 5 euros compensation if order isn't delivered in time. I got the compensation twice, but both ordered were send at the same time, so I could say that delay happened only once. Delay was a single day off, but still got the money.Coupons are great. I usually never use coupons, but those are very good. If you split your order nicely for coupons, you usually get 25-37.5% off everything you buy. Suggestions for Temu:Reviews:A compensation program for helpful item reviews would be great. I usually buy items with a lot of reviews, but sometimes I notice that when I leave a thorough (that gets 10+ helpful) positive review for an item with no reviews, it kickstarts sales dramatically. I wonder how much sales were made because of my positive reviews? Sharing wishlist:It would be cool if my friends and family could share their wishlists with me, so it would be easy for me to buy them something from the things they want.Edible things:I'd be happy to order some cool stuff like snacks, tea, coffee, candies.Anyway, Temu is great.",2025-06-11T15:37:20.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for your recognition.

5c1a98066598715ebc2c1166,Dom,GB,37,4,Temu is the dog's bollocks! These bad reviews are fake.,"I have bought many things from Temu since it opened and don't understand the low score on these reviews. I have received incredibly good quality items (5-10 times cheaper than on Amazon) as well as junk (hence the 4 stars instead of 5). But the junk were always refunded, most often without having to return them. If it is an expensive item, then you have (not always) to return it. Return is free. Payment of the refund is instant if you leave it on your acct at Temu. Or they refund to your initial mean of payment. This takes a few days.But the main reason why I love Temu is the phenomenal choice of items. If you are into DIY, or a fisherman, or need kitchen items, or tools, toys, bedding, gardening, music, you name it; anything is available at ridiculously low prices and often (not always) very good quality. I see some of them being sold 10x¬£s on amazon.It is actually very entertaining to browse those pages because they filled up with genius ideas.My only complain is that sometimes (not alway) the delivery takes long.You can buy stupid but day to day needed stuff you can't find anywhere else in small quantities. A bag of 100 elastics for ¬£0.30. Or a replacement handle for your beloved old pan lead for ¬£1.50. Or 150ml bottle of instant drying supper glue for ¬£2.50. Temu is the business. I truly think that most of these bad reviews are fake. Just black propaganda. Did you notice that Amazon now offers ""refund with no return"" options?

It is quick to refund and the process of making a claim is simple and straight forward. However, it is very much a case of 'Buyer Beware'!

In fact I haven't found one item advertised at the suggested TEMU RRP anywhere else. Furthermore, be careful on the 'special price' offered, and check elsewhere. I found 10mm round headed gold coloured nails at ¬£5.00 for 100 with a recommended retail price (RRP) of ¬£18.03 on TEMU, and 300 of the same nails for ¬£5.52 on Amazon!Update: TEMU have responded to my review and, as I stated right from the start, they are very good at looking after their customers with a quick and simple refund system, which works very well In their reply they have offered me a complete refund for any faulty goods I have received.

633953715a9ecb00128d1357,Ann Kelly,GB,3,1,"Misleading Product, Poor Quality and Awful Customer Service - Never Again","I ordered what was advertised as a Velvet Outdoor Lounge Set from TEMU on 8th May 2025, valued at ¬£34.50. The listing clearly showed and described chairs, a table, and a mat ‚Äì which I genuinely believed I would receive. What arrived on 9th June, after a month-long wait, was just a single mat/carpet. How can that possibly be worth ¬£34.50?This product was part of a free gift promotion, where I had to spend over ¬£35 on other items to qualify for 5 ""free gifts."" The lounge set was the one item I was really looking forward to ‚Äì it seemed like a fantastic deal. Unfortunately, all the items and so-called gifts I received were extremely poor quality and not worth the money at all.This mat was the final straw. I‚Äôve spent hundreds of pounds with TEMU over the last year, but after this experience, I will never order from them again.Their customer service is horrendous ‚Äì nothing but repetitive responses from what seems like an AI bot. No genuine human help. They only offer credit notes, not proper refunds, which is unacceptable. I strongly believe this is a case of false advertising and product manipulation and TEMU should be investigated under the Trade Descriptions Act.Overall, TEMU sells cheap, low-value goods disguised with attractive photos and misleading descriptions. I would advise everyone to think twice before spending their money. I‚Äôm deleting the app and won‚Äôt be coming back.",2025-06-10T09:19:39.000Z,,"Hello Ann, thank you for reaching out to us.

First order included a roll of thin copper sheet, the second 4 sheets of A3 laser marking paper. They were thrown into a mail bag and packaged with other items.The copper foil roll was squashed and consequently creased. The paper was wrinkled and cracked. I managed to sort the copper roll out but the paper is unusable.I asked for a refund for the paper and got it straight away. However, I will not order from Temu again as it appears to be more likely that as a result of poor packaging my purchases will arrive damaged. I would save time and an unnecessary inconvenience by buying from UK suppliers, where packaging is more robust.",2025-06-10T09:14:27.000Z,,"Hello Anthony, thank you for reaching out to us.

6847be5af0e9f320976a56be,Mike O,GB,1,1,Temu advert (google play),"Greetings . In general I have found shopping with Temu to be tolerable, however getting issues fixed does take time. My major gripe this time is that, have played a game on google play a Temu adverts comes up stating if you down load the app from the link on the ad you can get an Android Tablet with accessories for free. In reality there is no Tablet on offer you have to spend ¬£50.00 in order to get 6 free gifts while thqat might seem a good deal, The fact remains there is no tablet anywhere near the same as the one suggested in the advert available. This is quite frankly , misleading, inaccurate and unethical. I have no doubt that inthe small print under rules etc which are not easily visible ;they will some how wriggle out of responsibility like the slippery eels they are. So please beware of such ads. The old saying, If it seems to good to be true, It probably will be . Take care out there . NB. I have no doubt this will be followed up by a pointless generic fob off and even worse a false apology. I very much doubt anything i have posted will be read by the unfortunate agent that gets lumbered with this . Sappers do not roll over UBIQUE !! ...Update 14.6.25 . Despite several communications with Temu. They have done nothing to address this issue. However I did get this reply from the agent I spoke with on the website ..'We can totally understand why you're feeling disappointed and frustrated with the misleading advertising you've encountered, especially with multiple fake adverts that have affected your trust in us. If we were in your shoes, we would feel the same way, and we're truly sorry for all the inconvenience and distress this has caused you, leading to your decision to close your account.' I doubt anything will change I have no trust in this company at all . Please tread carefully with them. Kind Regards Mike O' I have already contacted Temu support, they did nothing, I gave them fair warning that if they did not honour the advert I would report Temu and give negative feed back here on Trustpilot",2025-06-14T04:31:23.000Z,,"Hello Mike, thank you for participating in our promotional activities and we are sorry that you are experiencing difficulties with your rewards.

67fec9a8a8b3e61f4d9bcef4,Ali Rajabi,GB,1,1,Somebody sue this company,"Absolute horrible service. Personal belongings got damaged by a product. Not my fault. Contacted their customer service multiple times. They created me a ticket. They asked for evidence and in such a way to make it impossible. For example my coat was ruined by a waterproofing spray. They asked for a pictures. That‚Äôs fine. Then they make you wait. I have waited for over 4 months. Every day I message them on the ticket. They‚Äôre meant to reply within 24 hours but sometimes they take up to 2 days and sometimes they don‚Äôt even reply till you message again. After these 4 painful months of going back and fourth they ask for a damage report. Where do I get that from? Seriously? I did eventually get 1 after paying a company. Then they asked for proof of purchase to confirm the price (expensive jacket). AFTER ALL THIS, they offer ¬£150. ¬£150. Not in money but in credit. I‚Äôve been trying to raise this. No. It won‚Äôt go up no matter what even though the coat costs ¬£500 (arcteryx) and is ruined. Funny thing is their terms and conditions clearly state they are liable for all damages. I don‚Äôt even know how they havnt been shut down and sued. When I tried contacting their legal department through the email listed for that department they say it‚Äôs not for the uk? Yes it is. They‚Äôre lying. Then they say go through the app. How am I meant to go to your legal department through the app? They‚Äôre just trying to down play it.

682df1864e662d8eac1e473f,Lisa Taylor,US,2,1,Orders placed without my authorization!!,"Its been over 2 weeks. I placed 1 order on the 5/23. On 5/24 their were 4 more transactions made that i know i didn't place or authorize. A total of $135.71. Things i wouldn't order or spend that much money on. They keep saying i did and found no issue on there end. Why would I lie!!?? I tried telling them when I first noticed a pool being shipped. I want my money back and they can send someone here to pick this heavy stuff up because I'm unable to! They will scam you eventually, some things are to good to be true!! A pool, a hammock, some clothesline, 10 plastic containers, king size heavy duty vinyl tarp. I wouldn't order these things!!! And why wouldn't I place those items with my order on the 23rd if I truly wanted them? They will not take ownership of the error on there end! Its scary they will do this and say it's totally your fault! Something happened on Temu's end. I only placed 1 order for some flowers, flower seeds, a book and some oil. The next day I noticed a pool saying it shipped! I looked into Temu and seen not only a pool, but a hammock, they were there most expensive but seen other items as well that i didn't order. I immediately contacted them to STOP those shipments and that I did not order those items. They said they have investigate and assured me it would be taken care of. Well they shipped. They said I could return the items but they are heavy and don't live close to a shipping station. I told them all that! Chatted with their customer service for 3 days to stop them, i didn't order them but they shipped them anyways. They need to be stopped, Im sure this has happened to others! They since refunded the hammock without a return however, Im still stuck with those other items I did not order. They said nothing happened on their end. WRONG! It did! I'm extremely upset, I don't like being called a liar and they need to refund me for all those other items I did not order! So, please everyone be very very careful it will happen to you! They could've stopped all those items from being shipped as soon as I contacted them however, their so called ""investigation"" let it happen!

I have been a Temu customer for more than 3 years and have ordered products in the range of 2000‚Ç¨. Everything seemed to be perfect but in the past year I have experienced a number of issues. Late delivery, incomplete orders, misleading product listings, increase in lead time etc. But the worst is when I log into the app there is always a ‚Äúreward or excellent product discounts‚Äù, when checking the products they in fact have an enormous discount, some even have discounts of 70% but beware! These discounts are fraudulent as the products are on a selected page and the customer is not able to see the real price in normal circumstances. For example they advertise an item for 20‚Ç¨ with a 50% discount dropping the price to 10‚Ç¨, the customer seems satisfied with this discount but in reality there is no discount because if you search the app for the same product on the main page you will see that in fact there is absolutely no discount.

5849b7010000ff000a5f9ea6,James Greyson,GB,3,1,Zero interest in protecting their possibly bleeding workers,"Excellent quality in about 1/3 items. Another 1/3 ok and 1/3 unusable (defective, broken or misdescribed) which is manageable due to low prices, free returns and helpful live chat. Temu are used by many sellers for warehouse clearance of second-quality stock so Temu should update their business model to include an option to buy seconds cheaper, rather than pretending that everything is the same high quality. However they deserve 1 star or less for ignoring my report of an item with apparent spots of blood around the lid (shining under UV light). Customer service opened a ticket a week ago but have since sent only repeated auto-type replies (""If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact us"") whilst totally ignoring all my questions about the possible worker bleeding whilst making items for them. They have a public ethical policy although it may not be operating at all since my email to the reporting address it gives was picked up by a US after-sales bot 'we are unable to access your account information from the country/region you are currently contacting us from'. Temu show zero capability for handling a serious worker safety report so I assume zero interest in worker safety and zero action being taken to investigate the factory or protect their possibly bleeding workers. Edit after temu's reply (below). Temu focus on the product, which was of course not the problem (they already kindly refunded). Totally looking the other way when there is blood on items probably means it's not just a matter of a worker forgetting their gloves one day. It may mean their ethical policy is unimplemented, temu is investigating nothing and the temu should themselves be rigorously investigated to establish the extent of any temu supplier workforce mistreatment.Edit after trustpilot contacted me for purchase order and telephone info to respond to temu's apparent request for my review to be removed as non-genuine. Temu know it's genuine as I've been discussing the issue with them daily since may 25th on a customer service ticket in my name.Edit after temu closed my customer service ticket with no acknowledgement or solution for anything I raised. 15 auto-responses in reply to my 12 detailed respectful questions. They invited a review of their service, I wrote...Uncaring and bad business. Shameful.Closed the ticket without any meaningful response on any of the 5 issues raised. Temu should be able to discuss all 5 but attempted zero. The irony is that all the issues are good for temu to solve, but bad for business and reputation to ignore.

5c49c5444f06b9a08bfd4b5e,PLS,GB,33,1,Really Bad. They do not care about clients. Just money,"Really Bad. 2nd order made ""Order time: Apr 21, 2025, Order ID: PO-186-16897124262951540"", 2nd time they completely messed it up. Once again the package did not arrive. TEMU FAILED AGAIN. Back in April I made an order. As a condition to the order I advised that I would be in Hospital until 27th May (due to a knee replacement operation. Obviously I cannot walk far). I asked for delivery to my home address, on or after 28th May AND U requested that the delivery company call me beforehand by telephone. When I arrived home the stupid delivery company lied and said they had trieded to deliver twice BEFORE 28th May! No calls were received. IDIOTS!. I called the delivery company, they talked over me, were very rude, and hung up the telephone. I contacted and emailed TEMU 8 times, but they did nothing as usual, A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME. Every day I get an email stating ""my package is waiting for me to collect it"" & ""Get in touch with the delivery company""!!!!! FOOLS, HOW AM I GOING TO COLLECT IT? I sent them a photo of my operated knee. They did not bother to reply. The delivery company have a simple garage attached to a private house, in Vecindario, it is some an hour away from my home! I CANNOT WALK!!! IDIOTS. The delivery company Hispapost have over 15000 bad reviews for ""non-delivery"" and lies on TrustPilot! Once again, I will not be receiving anything from TEMU. They do not care about their clients. They have cheated me out of my money, wasted my time and caused me a lot of stress. Last week, I instructed my lawyer to claim damages against TEMU in the Las Palmas de Gran Canaria Small Claims Court. I would not recommend TEMU to anyone. They seem like a good business, but they are let down by terrible delivery companies and bad/disinterested Client Services. Paul Lee STAINTON X2437784Z3rd June 2025Muy mal.

TEMU FALL√ì DE NUEVO.En abril hice un pedido. Como condici√≥n para el pedido, inform√© que estar√≠a hospitalizado hasta el 27 de mayo (debido a una operaci√≥n de reemplazo de rodilla. Obviamente, no puedo caminar mucho).Ped√≠ la entrega a mi domicilio el 28 de mayo o despu√©s, y solicit√© que la empresa de reparto me llamara por tel√©fono antes.Cuando llegu√© a casa, la est√∫pida empresa de reparto minti√≥ y dijo que hab√≠an intentado entregar dos veces ¬°ANTES del 28 de mayo! No recib√≠ ninguna llamada. ¬°IDIOTAS!Llam√© a la empresa de reparto, me interrumpieron, fueron muy groseros y colgaron el tel√©fono. Contact√© y escrib√≠ a TEMU 8 veces, pero no hicieron nada, como siempre. ¬°UNA P√âRDIDA DE TIEMPO!Todos los d√≠as recibo un correo que dice ""Mi paquete est√° esperando a que lo recoja"" y ""¬°Ponte en contacto con la empresa de reparto!"".¬°TONTOS! ¬øC√ìMO VOY A RECOGERLO? Les envi√© una foto de mi rodilla operada. Ni se molestaron en responder. La empresa de reparto tiene un sencillo garaje junto a una casa particular en Vecindario, ¬°a una hora de mi casa! ¬°NO PUEDO ANDAR! ¬°IDIOTAS! La empresa de reparto Hispapost tiene m√°s de 15.000 malas rese√±as por ""no entrega"" y miente en TrustPilot.Una vez m√°s, no recibir√© nada de TEMU. No les importan sus clientes. Me han estafado, me han hecho perder el tiempo y me han causado mucho estr√©s.La semana pasada, le di instrucciones a mi abogado para que reclamara da√±os y perjuicios a TEMU en el Juzgado de Menor Cuant√≠a de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. No recomendar√≠a TEMU a nadie.

I waited a month, it came to my country and finally Temu refused to deliver it to my city. I needed it for my upcoming trip in a few days, so it ruined my experience. Their support said it will be delivered and to contact the courier, then another support agent said it won't be delivered.They offered 20% discount up to 39 BGN on all orders. After making a small order just to test it, I got a 9 BGN discount. I wanted to use the rest 30 BGN discount that was promised but Temu support refused that. I spent literally over 3 hours chatting with them, they were very unprofessional and sent only copy-paste generic responses. I insisted to escalate it to a manager and they made a ticket which was closed within 1 min. with the same copy-paste response from a 'senior' who obviously hadn't even read my message. Then I insisted to make another ticket 1748375493032845, but got the same copy-paste messages, with the exception that this time they make me wait a day to get each of their copy-paste responses that don't help at all.All in all, Temu's customer support has degraded dramatically in the recent months.

In Canada, they use a delivery service called PDN Express, which has numerous negative reviews and a reputation for questionable practices. In my case, they falsely marked my package as delivered when it never arrived. It's frustrating that Temu continues to partner with such an unreliable carrier. Once the sale is complete, it seems like customer support and accountability are no longer a priority.

50bfd5f80000640001292264,Pascale,BE,128,1,Even 1 star is too much!!,"Even 1 star is too much!!! Absolutely outrageous service ‚Äî 3 hours wasted, then she disappeared.I spent over 3 hours in the Timu customer service chat today trying to solve a very simple issue.I placed ONE order, which Timu decided to split into THREE separate packages. Now I want to return some items, but the website only allows one free return and only shows two of the three packages ‚Äî so I cannot combine everything into a single return. That means I‚Äôd have to pay out of pocket to ship part of my return back to China, which can cost ‚Ç¨80+. I refuse to do that.I explained the situation calmly, clearly, and repeatedly. I even sent screenshots and detailed messages (written with help from ChatGPT to avoid confusion). I broke it down into small parts to make it easier for the agent to understand. But she didn‚Äôt answer a single one of my questions. Not one.All she did in 3 hours was refund me for one broken cat fountain. That‚Äôs it.Then, after 3 hours of chat, and without warning, she suddenly asked, ‚ÄúAre you still there?‚ÄùYes, I was ‚Äî I had just gone to the bathroom for 3 minutes. When I came back, she was gone. No goodbye. No warning. No solution.And I‚Äôm left with a large return I can‚Äôt process and a situation she never resolved. I feel like I‚Äôm living in a twilight zone. It‚Äôs surreal. How can you be in customer service and just vanish after 3 hours of ignoring someone?This is not customer service. This is a broken, robotic, scripted system that wastes your time and leaves you worse off than when you started.Timu: you wasted my entire Sunday evening.This experience was outrageous.And, she ignored ALL my very clear structured messages......and offered in those 3 hours not 1 solution. So now I'm stuck. I need to return it, the website doesn't allow it and I'm not paying for the items I want to return and certainly not paying for any shipping cost of the return package. ------------Update in response to Timu‚Äôs reply:You asked for additional information, and I‚Äôve filled in what I can ‚Äî but please note: your system only allows one order number, while this issue involves three separate packages from a single order.The core issue remains unresolved:I spent over three hours in chat with your customer service explaining this problem in detail ‚Äî that your website only allows one free return and doesn‚Äôt let me combine items from all three packages. I cannot return everything without paying high shipping costs, and I was offered no solution.Yes, I was refunded for a broken cat fountain ‚Äî but that wasn‚Äôt the main issue. The refund was delayed because your team kept asking multiple times how I wanted to receive it, even though I clearly said twice: via the original payment method.After all that, I was told the ‚Äúproblem was solved‚Äù ‚Äî because I don‚Äôt need to return the broken item. But the actual problem ‚Äî the return of multiple packages ‚Äî was never addressed. I‚Äôm still stuck.I honestly wonder if your support staff even read the structured messages I sent ‚Äî because I repeated myself clearly and calmly for hours. And still: no answers. Just delays, copy-paste replies, and more confusion.You wasted my Sunday evening, and now you‚Äôre wasting my time again. Please escalate this to someone who can offer an actual solution. I have a surgery this week and cannot keep repeating myself endlessly.----------Update for TEMU to your reply: Update:Thanks for your reply, but I‚Äôve already explained my situation multiple times and never received real support. This message is clearly automated and doesn't acknowledge the actual issue. If you truly care about customer satisfaction, read what I wrote and respond accordingly.-------------------Review:Today is June 2nd. I went back into the Temu chatroom again to try and resolve an issue with a simple return.Once again, they ignored everything I said, repeated prefab answers, and told me to ‚Äúwait 24 hours‚Äù for the higher department to respond. I told them, repeatedly, that I am having back surgery in 24 hours, and will not be able to contact them, coz I'm in the OR and return the package afterward because I won‚Äôt be able to walk.She kept ignoring thisI explained it calmly, then clearly, then urgently. They just kept saying, ‚Äúwe understand, but you have to wait.‚Äù Wait for what? For your mistake to become my burden?I offered to donate the pillow I can‚Äôt return. I uploaded screenshots. I solved most of it myself, without their help. And still, no resolution‚Äîonly robotic replies and zero accountability.Temu, your customer service is a disaster. It doesn‚Äôt listen. It doesn‚Äôt act. It doesn‚Äôt care.And Giovanna R. is by far the most unhelpful, inattentive customer agent I‚Äôve dealt with. But so are the others I had to deal with.

They rarely give details about the item and or accurate specifications. They advertise things like real leather, real this or that, but most of the time is not even real, but synthetic stuff. I have had good stuff from Temu, but it is a hit and miss. Recently I bought items for my business to use as merchandise, over ¬£400 worth, and only 50% of it I would use without feeling embarrassed about it. The rest is junk. I have returned a few things for a full refund. I have now learnt not to expect a lot from Temu, and if the item is similar price elsewhere, then I will not buy from Temu, as they take forever to get the items to us and it may not even be as expected.

BE WARNED if you place an item in your cart the price will change and go up. By the time you check out it may double in price. I have checked and checked and still got caught out with the price altering - they call it a sale or lightening sale. SO just be warned I recently put something in my cart at $45 still that when I approved payment then after payment it was $115. Difficult to cancel order at that point as payment has already been taken. Returning objects can also be a nightmare as you have to drop it to the closest collection point which is only open during office hours and can be an hour away.

They ship your packages in little plastic bags with the tiny ones not making it though the mail. I though at first they were being stolen and asked the mail delivery to leave them at my door. This was ignored so, I contacted Temu and asked them to send a notice with my packages to leave them at my door, and to please box the items so less will get lost in the mail. They just give you the run around with no results. So, every time a package does not arrive when they say it has been delivered, Temu give you the run around when requesting a refund. They want proof! There is no proof! It did not arrive!! So, the result is no refund. Then you take it to customer service who gives you lip service. Also no results.

66b5c292ce77db0ce6f475bd,Lorraine Harvey,CA,2,1,Buyer Beware,"I purchased two night tables which were advertised as ""local."" I paid for them but when I received confirmation of the sale, there was $72 in import duties charged. I complained, and indicated that I would be returning them. I was instructed to arrange for the shipping, pay for it, and I would be reimbursed, but they only reimbursed me for the cost of the items, not the duty and not the shipping charges. it took several weeks to get the refund and I am now arguing with them over the shipping charges and the duty. They now say that I will not receive a refund on the duty because it was not their fault nor was it the fault of the manufacturer. However, it was advertised as ‚ÄúLocal‚Äù which to me means it‚Äôs in my country or my city and therefore I should not have had to pay duty. It‚Äôs actually kind of interesting because when I was initiating the complaint, their agents agreed that it said local but still denied that they were responsible. I think they just try to out-wait you and hope you‚Äôll go away.There is an update to the above. Perhaps due to my persistence, TEMU has now processed a credit equal to the return shipping charges, but still take no responsibility for the fact the the item was described as ""Local"" yet was actually shipped from the US which resulted in import charges. I will likely use up this credit but after that is gone, do not think I will deal with them again because they are not particularly good at taking responsibility for their own errors.My best advice is not to buy anything too expensive from them so you won't experience what I went through.",2025-05-31T18:05:25.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

64f96e2f3eb8ec00120a9126,TN,AU,3,1,Will Not Be Ordering Again from Temu in a Hurry - Order ID: PO-012-[REDACTED NUMBER HERE],"i ordered a 4TB USB HDD from temu (Order ID: PO-012-[REDACTED NUMBER HERE]). this item was intended as a gift.today the temu package arrived and it was not the item that i had ordered and paid for. instead of the 4 TB HDD i had ordered, i received an SSD device - a completely different item, and not what i wanted.so now i have an item that i cannot use as the gift i had intended.i go online and request a refund using temu's 'request a refund' (non-human) process. i complete all the online prompts and reach the 'print return label' section.this does not bode well.i do not have a printer, and i am certainly not interested in purchasing one just to print a return label for an item that was mistakenly posted to me. furthermore, having increasingly problematic chronic groin pain (as a result of 3 bilateral groin surgeries), i have enough trouble going to the WC, let alone outside of my residence.there is no facility online to request that temu or the seller send me a return label by post, which i can then attach to the item and then have the postal worker that delivers my mail to my residence take the package for a return.temu's online links take me to an automated chat system that instructs me to go to a post office or library etc. to print the label. this is not an option for me or generally for people with disabilities or impairments of one kind or another.the seller sent me the wrong item - it is their responsibility, not the buyers' to jump through hoops.in fact, the buyer, in addition to receiving an immediate refund, should be compensated for having their time and effort wasted due to seller-instigated errors.i will be issuing a charge-back request if i do not receive an immediate refund, and i will not be inclined to purchase any further items from temu. this is my second purchase from temu, and we already have a 50% strike (or error) rate - not good.if temu read this, please don't bother asking me to go online (again), or use the temu app. - i have already been online searching for help to no avail - and i will not be wasting any more of my time.very disappointed.------------------------------------AN UPDATE - JUNE 2, 2025------------------------------------after writing the aforementioned review a few days ago i received an e-mail from TRUSTPILOT asking me to click a link in the same e-mail as TEMU apparently wanted a little more information regarding my TRUSTPILOT review above.i clicked the link and was taken to a page asking me for my full name, temu order number/ID, and my telephone number.i completed the online form.today (june 2, 2025) i received an e-mail from my payment processor indicating that a full refund of my temu purchase has been issued, and an e-mail from TEMU HELP (help [AT] service.temu.com) apologizing for the events following my purchase.---------------------------------MY TAKE-HOME MESSAGE:---------------------------------if you have a genuine grievance, take the time to go online and create a TRUSTPILOT (or other review site) review.even if your complaint is not resolved to your satisfaction, other (potential) buyers may find your experience(s) useful.best wishes.oh, i have redacted my temu Order ID that i provided in my original review above just to be safe.have a good day.",2025-06-13T13:12:45.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

6821356a75d981da0382fd27,mark roberts,AU,5,1,May 2025,"Update, a reply to Temu's feedbackFirst, I dont believe for one second Temu is ""sorry I'm not satisfied with some of my items. Second, not some goods, all of them! I can forward photos to you and Trustpilot if you like and you can compare to Temu's website. Take the time to look at the pictures I posted and tell me that you would find these products acceptable. Third is a lie: clearly you do not have any quality control. If you did you would not have dared sent this rubbish, and to be clear, I mean goods that look absolutely nothing like the photos on your website. In fact, I would go as far as to say that what you are doing is fraud. A couple of months ago, I bought a rug and it is satisfactory - not great but ok - this time, however, the quality of the goods $150 worth of goods is so bad, so awful i've requested refunds (I have photos!). The problem is Temu only allows one refund per delivery, and one return. Ah ha! got ya! haven't they. You might occasionally get lucky but odds are most goods on Temu are rubbish; and if you must order from them I would advise that you only order one item at a time. That way you stand a better chance of getting a refund without all the hassle of making a return - who has the time? - and of course Temu banks on that very fact. Rubbish, rubbish, rubbish. And, finally, if anyone customer is reading this, Temuballows for one refund and one return per order. So if you buy a bundle of stuff, which I'm sure a lot of people do, you can only claim a small partial refund; you lose no matter how Temu wants to 'redirects your attention.",2025-05-29T12:38:50.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for shopping on Temu!

5d650f0a48da2a6d3df9bdf9,Dominic Meli,GB,4,1,DO NOT SHOP WITH TEMU.,"This is the third time my leaving this review. Temu and trustpilot have worked in collusion to keep removing my honest review and making it generally hard to leave another, but persistence is key and I've found a way. I bought a composter from temu which arrived with a wrong part and temu helpline message service almost drove me around the bend with repeated questions and swapping operatives so I had to explain myself over and over. I got an email from them saying how they take it seriously bs bs bs because that was ages ago and I've heard nothing since. I also tried ordering the part, but an awkward seller chose to reply at a snails pace and at one point I couldn't return it or get the part and I finally got a refund which was enough to take to a local engineering firm and have the incorrect piece altered so that it would fit. But the whole process was an absolute nightmare and as a result, I would strongly advise anyone against shopping with temu, the more expensive products are the same as anywhere else, but the smaller stuff tends to be a bit naf, but their customer services leave a hell of a lot to be desired, they literally had me wanting to pull my hair out and I honestly cannot remember the last time I have felt so LIVID because of some idiot in the wrong job asking me the same questions over and over and it was deliberate which was absolutely crystal clear if you could read the chat. Anyway, just don't shop here and temu, here is the number you keep asking for again. I'm sure you'll have it deleted by your trusty the lapdog and so I'll see you in the 4th negative review. PO-210-21616529807912082UPDATE, you complain about their chat facility and customer services and temu then ask you tou put yourself through it again where you'd have to explain the whole thing to them and still get nowhere. Temu customer services will frustrate you beyond reasonable. Just do yourself a favour and don't ever shop with them. They really don't care about their customers. And I'm not reaching out to you temu, I'm reviewing you on trustpilot to expose you, but its like I've said already, you're in collusion with them",2025-05-29T09:41:12.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

6835546e8a53751724518e64,Patrick Ziegler,FR,1,1,Terrible customer service and failed delivery ‚Äì never ordering from Temu again,"I placed an order with Temu that was supposed to be redelivered on May 24th. As of today, nothing has arrived. No one answers the phone, the delivery driver ignores repeated calls, and customer support has been utterly unhelpful.The first agent I spoke with didn‚Äôt even realize the tracking system had the wrong address. I had to ask twice before they finally checked. No wonder the package never showed up.To make matters worse, I received a call from the delivery company five days ago, asking if I spoke Thai and saying they couldn‚Äôt locate my address. Clearly, the item was already out for delivery, yet Temu completely failed to manage the situation.This order was meant as a surprise for my daughter, and Temu‚Äôs incompetence has ruined it.I‚Äôve now deleted my Temu account and will never order from them again. I‚Äôll also be sharing this experience on the Apple App Store, Google Play, and other review platforms to warn others.Final verdict: A complete waste of time, full of frustration, and a shocking lack of accountability.Update, 28.05.2025: After multiple emails, phone calls, and a completely failed redelivery, Temu only bothered to respond AFTER I posted a negative review on Trustpilot. That alone speaks volumes about how seriously they take customer service.What did I get? A token ‚Äúcompensation‚Äù of ‡∏ø70 credit (barely ‚Ç¨2) and a 20% discount coupon ‚Äî not as an apology, but clearly as a thinly veiled sales tactic.Let‚Äôs be clear:This is not compensation ‚Äî this is a manipulative push to make me place another order, even though the first package still hasn‚Äôt arrived. To make matters worse, the coupon is only valid until May 31st, essentially pressuring me to buy again within a week, or lose it. That‚Äôs not customer support ‚Äî that‚Äôs predatory marketing.And still: no package, no apology, no real solution.This entire experience has been appalling. What was meant to be a special surprise for my daughter has turned into a time-consuming mess of frustration, delays, and indifference. I‚Äôve already deleted my Temu account, and I will continue warning others on YouTube and other review platforms.If you‚Äôre thinking about ordering from Temu, ask yourself:Are you ready to be ignored, gaslighted, and handed a promo coupon instead of real help?I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äî and I won‚Äôt be coming back.",2025-05-28T04:32:07.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

I did log in every day, but the app showed an error and didn‚Äôt let me claim the bonus. I contacted support, and they acknowledged the issue and promised to credit the bonuses manually. But that never happened. Later, they changed their story and claimed I had received the rewards which is completely false.And just today they offered me to add just 15‚Ç¨ instead of 45‚Ç¨, which I had to get. Second, I used Temu‚Äôs official ‚Äúprice adjustment‚Äù feature on a previous order. After that, I was silently banned from participating in promotions without any warning or explanation. This condition wasn‚Äôt mentioned in any promo terms, and support again denied responsibility.It feels like Temu blocks users from rewards as soon as they actually stand to benefit.

Yet this is just one bag and there is 10 or even 100 seller selling them. I guess others can be good, so it's again about luck. Except electric stuff...

68301757f0e9f31c3b521224,Rog Yar,AU,2,1,Why TEMU Price Adjustment Isn't a Courtesy-It's a Control Tactic,"Have you noticed TEMU‚Äôs latest marketing tactic that seems designed to exploit customers? Here‚Äôs how it works: they initially overcharge for a product, then, after your order is placed and delivered, they offer a ‚ÄúPrice Adjustment.‚Äù But there‚Äôs a catch: the refund isn‚Äôt returned to your original payment method. Instead, it‚Äôs issued as TEMU credit, effectively locking your money into their platform.This tactic subtly pressures customers to make another purchase, with a minimum spend of $40, just to use their credit. It‚Äôs a calculated way to retain customers without addressing product quality or service standards.Rather than focusing on genuine improvements, TEMU appears to be manipulating customer retention, hiding poor reviews, and profiting from a closed-loop credit system. When you raise concerns, they claim they want to ‚Äúserve you again,‚Äù but in reality, they‚Äôve created a system that forces you to return simply to recover money they refuse to refund properly.That‚Äôs not customer service. It‚Äôs manipulation, and for those fed up with low standards, it‚Äôs coercion. Walking away means saying goodbye to your credit, money TEMU gets to keep.",2025-05-24T12:15:50.000Z,,"Hi, Temu has established a minimum order value to enable us to provide a wider selection of lower-priced items to our customers, as the cost of shipping small orders is significantly higher.

682cc19a4e662d0a1d1ce348,Wasim Akram,SA,3,1,Formal Dispute and Request for Clarification Regarding Return Under Tracking #404388256269,"Temu Customer Service,I am formally dispute the handling of my recent return associated with tracking number 404388256269, and to request a detailed explanation regarding six additional items that you claim were received under this return but allegedly belong to another account.1. All Items Were Returned TogetherI returned a total of seven (7) items in one sealed parcel, using the return label and tracking number provided by Temu. The parcel, measuring 380mm x 470mm and weighing 1.70 kg, was shipped and delivered successfully. The tracking information confirms that the parcel was received by Temu.2. Acknowledgment of Six Extra ItemsYour team has acknowledged receiving six additional items in the same parcel but claims they are associated with another account. This assertion is not only improbable but unfounded, as the parcel was sealed by me and contained only the items I originally purchased and intended to return. It is unreasonable to suggest that items from another account could have been included without explanation.3. Lack of Logical ExplanationIf these six items do not belong to me, then the following critical questions must be addressed: ‚Ä¢ Why were these items received and processed under my tracking number? ‚Ä¢ Why were they accepted into your return system without being flagged at the time of receipt? ‚Ä¢ On what basis does Temu assert that these items belong to another customer without providing supporting evidence?4. Request for EvidenceTo resolve this matter transparently, I request the following: ‚Ä¢ A complete list of the six items you claim are from another account. ‚Ä¢ Concrete evidence proving these items were not included in my original order or return. ‚Ä¢ Any internal documentation, tracking logs, or audit trails linking these six items to a different account.5. Request for Immediate RefundGiven that: ‚Ä¢ I returned all seven of my items in a single, sealed parcel using the provided return label, ‚Ä¢ The parcel was delivered and received under the specified tracking number, ‚Ä¢ There is no presented evidence of any error or wrongdoing on my part,I am formally requesting a full refund for all seven items returned. The alleged presence of additional items should not delay or invalidate my refund, particularly in the absence of clear proof that the error originated from my side.",2025-05-23T09:26:08.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

671b7ec5edd214acb371a863,Chris Mitchell,GB,2,1,Temu and the mysterious case of the disappearing promotion.,"I'll be saying nothing that hasn't been said before in other reviews with regard to Temu promotions, however I believe it is important to continue to highlight the issue in the hope that Temu will eventually realise the level of customer dissatisfaction this causes and revise their practices accordingly. In essence, Temu applies money off promotions to customer accounts, and when the customer proceeds to checkout expecting the relevant discount to be deducted, the offer disappears without warning and checkout displays the full price again with no discount. This was the case again for me today (¬£7 off a ¬£7.01+ shop), and is just one of many such occurrences on my account. Customer service agents will claim that the promotions are time limited and will have expired when payment is attempted, however there is never any on screen indication of this to customers. Apart from these so called ""promotions"" being entirely misleading, not to mention unethical, customers can waste an inordinate amount of time choosing items to purchase to take advantage of the offer, only to be disappointed when it is inexplicably withdrawn. Interestingly, these particular promotions never seem to feature in the Expired Offers on customers' accounts, leading to suspicion that, in reality, they never actually existed in the first place and are simply a means of attempting to generate additional sales.",2025-05-23T00:07:05.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out, and we apologize that you are experiencing issues with our promotions.

And now Temu is BLATANTLY committing fraud by refusing to refund my order of $103.49 for two items I returned securely via the UPS QR Code they gave me for the return. I even have the receipt to prove the return was received by UPS and both items were sent inside of the same package. Temu waited a bit of time and then sent me a note buried inside of the app saying they declined the return. They gave 2 totally different reasons: 1) because the warehouse can‚Äôt find the items, so they can‚Äôt give me a refund. OR 2) they say the package the warehouse received was empty. Which makes ZERO sense, since UPS would not accept and give me a receipt for an empty package!! I spent over ONE HOUR on chat with customer service. And all they did was keep passing me around to 3 different departments who kept writing the same pre-written excuse with the 2 different ridiculous stories (wAREHOUSE can‚Äôt find the package or the package was empty when the WAREHOUSE received it.)I pointed out to them that I should not be penalized for what happens in their warehouse after they legitimately received the package through UPS, which is a reputable source. I also pointed out that maybe their warehouse staff stole the contents of the package?! I have demanded a refund but they continue to ignore me. I have been a loyal customer for a long time, but this is inexcusable and I want to warn people to NEVER shop with them again unless you want to be ripped off.My guess is that since the packages might be sent from China, now that they have new tariffs in place ‚Äî Temu simply doesn‚Äôt want to bother to ship the returned packages back, so they want to blame the customers by claiming that the packages weren‚Äôt received or were empty?!I wish I could give Temu ZERO stars‚Ä¶but the minimum allowed was 1 star.",2025-05-22T03:36:40.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

I was even contacted by Temu to give newspaper interviews, which I did not accept, not because I didn't believe in Temu but because the bad press, that could turn against me! Glad I didn't agree to defend them!!!! They have now shown their true colours for the sake a few pounds. Before there were times when I was begging to send the items back, but no, I would just get a refund and would have to give them again, now something is faulty I am treated in this way??? NO!I ordered a few things and sent back one pair of sunglasses I didn't feel had enough quality. Took a neck cushion on holidays, seemed OK, when I got back the foam had deteriorated or something and I had neck pain, so I talked to Temu about sending it back. They wanted postage costs for the first time. I pointed out that the items was faulty! They would hear. Contacted the next day again, received a return label, no talk about postage costs. I didn't trust it so before I sent it back I insisted on knowing if I would have to pay anything, told that if the item passed inspection then I would get my money. Now saw that they deducted the postage costs, so I didn't have the opportunity to say no and give the item away. If there is no assurance they deal with problems no one should buy with this company! They are now in the UK, but they won't give me the details of where I can complain, which by law they have to! I had seen quite a lot of reviews on their website of people complaining of the same problems, but it had never happened to me, now I am a victim too. Talked to a friend who also buys from Temu regularly, she is still treated well and her concerns still heard. Something is very wrong with this company. Also the costumer service, before very polite and willing to solve problems, no more! This could have happened because I was truthful in my reviews and even if they gave my money back I would tell the truth about the item. Disgraceful! UPDATE: Temu has now given my money back! Now I have to clarify whether one has any protection in case something goes wrong within reasonable time. So, I will be back shopping with Temu, but keeping my eyes wide open, and if things go wrong again, that will be the end of the road for me, which is sad.... before I honestly loved Temu!!!",2025-05-24T17:29:41.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out and we are sorry that you are not satisfied with your items.

Many of the products are exactly the same as the big brands in the UK and generally 1/5th of the price. Even own brands are double the priceTh of Temu. Quality is almost always excellent but photos arranged to suggest bigger products than arrive, so check dimensions which are always somewhere.

682b8d504db5a066fffe3447,SJ,GB,3,1,Absolutely Appalling Delivery Experience via Temu/Yodel - A Full Day Wasted and Now Inconveniencing Others,"My order from Temu, which was entrusted to Yodel for delivery, has resulted in an absolutely appalling experience. Today was supposed to be a straightforward delivery between 14:59 and 16:59. Like many, I had to rearrange my work schedule to ensure I was home during this window ‚Äì a sacrifice that has now proven to be a complete waste of my time, thanks to the poor delivery service.As I write this at 20:59, my parcel has still not arrived. Despite contacting Yodel's online chat facility (Temu's chosen courier), I was simply told to wait as the driver was supposedly in my area. This contradicted the tracking information, which clearly showed the driver moving further away from my location for the past three hours since 14:05 this afternoon. It's unacceptable that Temu would partner with a courier that provides such inaccurate information.The incompetence is staggering and reflects poorly on Temu's choice of delivery partner. Not only has Yodel, on behalf of Temu, wasted my entire afternoon and evening, but now I am forced to inconvenience a friend or family member by asking them to stay at my property tomorrow so I don't have to take another day off work. This disruption to my life is a direct consequence of the unreliable delivery service arranged by Temu.It's a stark contrast to how customers are treated. If I were to miss a payment to Temu, I'm sure consequences would follow. Yet, when their chosen courier completely disregards my time and disrupts my entire day, the expectation seems to be that I should simply accept it. This reflects poorly on Temu's customer service standards if they condone such poor delivery practices.I will update this review tomorrow to reflect how Yodel, on behalf of Temu, handles this situation and what new excuses they conjure up. As it stands, this entire delivery experience through Temu and their chosen courier has been nothing short of a complete and utter failure. Temu needs to seriously reconsider their delivery partnerships if they value customer satisfaction. Avoid ordering if you value your time and require reliable delivery.",2025-05-19T22:08:34.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us. We are sorry for any inconvenience caused.

Purchased party items where light up letters are chipped and broken, a slit in the bag where 2 items must have fallen out as they aren‚Äôt included, metal drink holders massively dented so un-useable. All in my opinion, avoidable by packing in a box. 100% would have made it to me in one piece if arrived in box. The exact same thing happened on my initial order. And I can see in these comments loads of comments about damaged items. So I leave this feedback in the hope they change this going forward. In all honesty the prices are cheap and I expect to be happy with some pieces and others not so, it‚Äôs the gamble of purchasing from these low priced sites. But I don‚Äôt get packing them in a way they are never ever going to make it to you in one piece. So with the party being a week away I can‚Äôt reorder damaged / missing items and guarantee getting in time. So disappointed when it‚Äôs in Temus control. Pls reconsider how you pack orders on orders that can break.",2025-05-18T09:41:26.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us. We are sorry for any inconvenience caused.

Finally made an enquiry with Temu for non receipt was sent a picture showing my packages in a recycling bin for which collection was Friday. I was horrified by what i discovered. I have not used recycling for ages but my neighbours do and uses the same boxes for rubbish. My packages was left on an insecure expose place at the front of the property in the open shallow recycling rubbish box. I had not receive notification of where it was left only on the app stating it was delivered but not me. Just left on open ground. Who would want anything delivered bythis method. I would never and did not instruct my packages to be left in this manner. Its totally unsafe. This is outrageous and callous. I've advised my whole family and friends not yo use the services as it's like throwing your hard earned money away. I've told my sister to cancel her recent order as she's unlikely yo get it in such a gamble to deliver. There no point. Temu don't deserve any points for the delivery services they provide.

5f33dab5335acc4a4f9642da,- Domingos Melo,PT,5,2,Discrepancies between TEMU Application and Site - Chat doesn't help,"I‚Äôve been a long-time customer, and while some of your products have met my expectations, the overall customer support experience has been disappointing. Whenever I encounter an issue and attempt to use the chat service for clarification, it typically proves unhelpful. Although the representatives are polite, my questions often go unanswered.My most recent concern, as of May 16, 2025, is the inconsistency between your advertisements and the actual availability of products and offers. For example, I saw a compact dishwasher promoted on Facebook, but I‚Äôve been unable to find it either on your website or in the app. Similarly, the app mentions a ‚Ç¨200 credit, yet there‚Äôs no clear information about this promotion anywhere. This lack of transparency is frustrating and undermines trust in your advertising.It was evident that the chat support could neither resolve my issue nor locate the product in question.TEMU does offer some good products. However, when it comes to addressing concerns or seeking direct explanations, the chat service is usually ineffective. Additionally, promotional offers seen on social media are difficult‚Äîif not impossible‚Äîto locate within the app or on the TEMU website. Reaching out via chat for assistance in these matters feels like a waste of time.This is my analysis.",2025-05-16T12:30:37.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

THE BANK OFFICER SAID THOSE PAYMENTS ARE NORMALLY CLEARED PROMPTLY SO THEN SHE ASKED ME TO USE ANOTHER CARD AND WE WENT ON TO TEMU WEBSITE AND I ENTERED THE CARD DETAILS AS PROMPTED BY THE BANK OFFICER, SO NOW TWO CARDS HAVE BEEN ENTERED ON THE SAME PURCHASE ORDER .

The goods are there and nothing is missing but the package had a tear hole in it & the one item wich is a knife sharpener has chafe marks on the one side wich makes it looks second hand and used, also the packet it was in has a hole in it on the sticker and thats probably how that marks got there wich tells me that this package was just tossed around everywhere it has traveled without fragile precaution wich in my eyes is very poor service. The other goods are ok, except that there is no instructions with it about how to use the product but i guess i can just google it. All in all im not really happy with the service & the red & black knife sharpener with the chafe marks on it. I like my stuff in perfect condition.Dont think i will order stuff online again soon in the near future.",2025-05-15T18:21:38.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for shopping on Temu!

I have ordered so many products the last 6 months, However, since recently my packages have not been delivered by the Srilankan courier company CEPEX. This company doesn't have a registered office, nor do they answer calls. I feel CEPEX is stealing our packages. Once they collect the parcel, they stick to it, and do not deliver.

581b076f0000ff000a53a8f2,David,GB,14,5,1st time Temu user,"okay, so I recently purchased a number of woodworking related items from Temu, and too be truthful, I was worried about the quality, this being the first time I've used them but I've seen a number of YouTube videos in relation to them, so thought that I would give it a go.Their advertising is a bit tacky, and I still have to work out what all their offers actually mean, especially the free ones (the only free thing I got was delivery).That said, most of the items I received are very good quality, especially when you take the price into consideration.The aluminium alloy items are solid, accurate, and excellent value.The wooden handles are not the highest quality, but they will do the job and are pennies, not pounds.As highlighted in several YouTube reviews, the main concern is the packaging, or should I say, lack of protective packaging. Get that right, and I will be buying a lot more items.I have already ordered several more items but purchased only certain products, being cognisant of the packaging issues.Despite these issues, the quality and price mean that it's 5 stars",2025-05-15T13:09:55.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for shopping with us and sharing your 5-star experience!

5ef3a3088158015b833169b0,F Williams,GB,10,5,Love it,"TEMU are by for the cheapest for nearly everything don't get me wrong there are a load of rubbish items but for instance an A4 plastic box not the best quality and the latches are naff but it's for keeping printer A4 paper in when you open a fresh pack it's crap but actually really handy keeping the rest in so it doesn't bend up or get dirty but there's also a lot of hidden gems for next to nothing money, plenty of tools which are pretty well made, clothing seems to be nothing but polyester but that's fine buy me there just like gym shirts quick drying and best of all if you hang them up after throwing them in the tumble dryer you don't need iron them and for ¬£3.50 a time you can't go wrong, memory foam trainer inserts are pot luck but for a quid I've had some nice ones and the others I'm not fussed about. Plenty of Nik Naks pipettes, sticky wall hooks, metal/plastic garden hose adapters, all types of washers even replacement ones for my garden pump sprayer, pressure washer attachments even usb c fly zappers you name it some are better than others but that's life, I do look through eBay and Amazon or Google items and I've only found one item cheaper on eBay and that was a stand for my Dyson V8 absolute but Dyson tools are cheaper on Temu most fit well one was slightly tight to fit but half the price compared to a Google search. There are some promotions you can get for shopping with them like ¬£8 off ¬£50 or there show you a page of discounts the trick is if you browse and find something you want do a search for that item and your have a page full of the exact same item but for pennies or pounds cheaper and once you've ordered, it can take a week to 10 days as it's shipped from china some are quicker as it's shipped by land tracked and you can look on Temu and see when it departs/arrives at airport and so on I've had 15/20 orders all turned up okay and you can click on your orders even after delivery for a price adjustment and if the person or Temu selling the item drops the price you can get 3p 30p paid back into your account for every item that's had a price drop and sending items back is a doddle just print off a returns label or do it at post office for post office or evri drop off point sometimes if it's only pennies they just don't bother asking you to send it back and you can just throw it away. There is a promo where you get an amount of credit back to spend picking the items from a page but it's in vouchers like spend ¬£30 get ¬£2 off I did it once then couldn't find the vouchers and to be honest I thought it would have been cash paid back into my Temu account but no, so avoid that one shows up in green but the rest are pretty good I've found items for ¬£19.99 with a promo they cut the price in half so save it for your most expensive item. I don't understand some of the reviews about things not turning up my evri driver is such a nice guy I don't think there having problems with Temu as it's all tracked but maybe the delivery guy or area there living in parcels are being robbed and so on I've not had a single issue.",2025-05-15T12:58:20.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for shopping with us and sharing your 5-star experience!

In our throw away world, no retailer stocks these because the Tab A was released 8 years ago. I came to TEMU, despite disliking everything about them, starting with ""shop like a billionaire."" Gag.

Even then I must go through ALL of the details and specifications to hopefully ensure I am buying what I think I'm buying.In short, it is far too much work to be able to make a questionable purchase.

I've been reasonable and just suggested they send me out a replacement solar panel and battery, you'd have thought that would be simple. Customer service are no help, robotic and very repeative. I've even reached out to the seller but 4 days later no response Now I've spent ¬£100's with them and if there's been an issue they have been OK but not on this occasion.

The table top had scratches and dents all over it, and the chairs had to be put together with screws, but the screws were not in the 2 boxes that came except in the table box, but not in the chair box. I went back to temu to get help for a return/refund and they sent one (1) fed ex label for the boxes that came. They said print the label for one box only. So I messaged them again for a second label to send the other box back, but they refused. They said I have to send the 2nd box back at my expense and they are not sending a label for the other one, even though the patio set arrived in two boxes. Trying to get help through the merchant was a waste of time. Trying to get help through temu customer service is very stressful because they were no help either.The 2nd box that we still have has the dented and scratched up table top. I even sent them pictures of the damaged table top but they do not care. The chairs were only sent back via fedex because of the ONE (1) return label. They take days to respond. Now I'm going to do a dispute with my credit card company. UPDATE: Temu will not follow up on this matter because if they were serious they would not have replied saying contact them through Temu.com or chat live because they know they trained their workers not to do a refund and give every excuse through their canned message system. Since they have a headquarters in Boston in a suite on the 3rd floor of the building they are renting out of, it is time to take this further to make headlines about how they don't take matters like this seriously, and how they have no problem keeping someone else's money and I have a damaged tabletop that they refuse to send another return label so I can't send it back like i did the chairs. Today, I received the screws in the mail to put the chairs together. I ALREADY SENT BACK THE CHAIRS LAST WEEK via their fedex return label. When we first discussed the screws with the Temu merchant they said it could take 2 weeks to a month to get them here. We don't need the screws now! The chairs are returned!!!! Send another return label for the tabletop and then refund us in full!!

669fea963397d97d1f7187c6,Caleb Hawn,CA,3,3,I just had my first experience with Temu...,"I just had my first experience with this company. As a moderately canny consumer, I found the website kind of hilarious - ten thousand pop-ups, massive ""limited time"" deals (on items that are never actually on sale for full price), random opportunities for store credits to keep you coming back, last second previously-unmentioned shipping restrictions that require you to up the price of your order just a little more, every trick in the capitalist's handbook to squeeze just a little bit more money out of you.Additionally, the quality of the products are sure to be utter garbage. For these prices, it's almost more alarming if the items look good when you finally receive them. Even Homesense fails on basic radiation and lead regulations these days, so a nameless chinese vendor offering the sun and moon for 10$ is more suspicious by default.As long as you keep in mind that there's a bunch of hidden trade-offs to even make this business model possible and treat it like it's a legal black market, you can find some cool stuff. Just do some research. I would personally avoid any category of product that'd have prolonged contact with your skin like clothes or cosmetics.

67f020e289ee14780a5679a6,Jan,CZ,23,1,A Disappointing Experience with Temu.com ‚Äì Privacy Concerns and Unresponsive Communication,"I recently had an experience with Temu.com that left me feeling uneasy and frustrated. Initially, I was interested in exploring a potential collaboration with them, as their platform seemed to offer some promising features and functionalities. However, what unfolded was a sequence of events that raised serious concerns about privacy, transparency, and overall trustworthiness.First and foremost, I encountered several indicators that suggested Temu.com might be engaging in practices that could be perceived as spyware. While I cannot definitively confirm this, I noticed unusual data access requests and unexplained background processes while interacting with their platform. These actions left me questioning the integrity of their operations and the security of user data. In a digital landscape where privacy is paramount, any ambiguity surrounding data handling is deeply unsettling.Furthermore, when I attempted to reach out to Temu.com to discuss potential business collaboration, I was met with silence. Despite multiple attempts to connect through their contact forms and email support, I received no response. It is perplexing that a company claiming to provide cutting-edge services would be so unresponsive to potential partners. This lack of communication not only diminished my interest in collaboration but also amplified my concerns about their overall professionalism.Another aspect worth mentioning is the opacity surrounding their privacy policies and data handling practices. Upon reviewing their documentation, I found it to be vague and lacking in clear explanations regarding how user data is collected, stored, and potentially shared. In today‚Äôs world, transparency is not just a best practice ‚Äì it is an expectation. Temu.com's failure to provide clear, straightforward information only fuels suspicions about what might be occurring behind the scenes.In conclusion, my experience with Temu.com was marked by unresponsiveness, questionable data practices, and a general sense of unease. I sincerely hope they address these issues, as their platform has potential. However, until they provide clearer communication, transparent data handling policies, and a commitment to user privacy, I cannot in good conscience recommend them. Potential collaborators and users alike should exercise caution and seek more reliable, open, and communicative partners in the tech space.",2025-05-11T07:42:44.000Z,,"Hello Jan, thank you for your feedback!

Cons: products over a certain $ amount will automatically be financed and you can't just pay for it up front. Don't ask why, i think its so they can continue to bombard you with ads for stuff.

I have tried chat linked to the PO-210-09687636621351760 to explain the situation, but without success, because I have received a refund for that order. As I have already told you, I received no emails after I had placed Order ID: PO-210-******4941 4932 832 delivered March 29, 2025 Tracking no H-0483-a-114879492-5, either confirming or supplying delivery updates regarding that order. However, the delivery did arrive. I can only assume that you sent everything to the wrong email address. If you check order PO-210-09687636621351760 you will find my correct email address.

56d8cbe10000ff000a0b96df,Cecille,US,3,4,I was very afraid of shopping at TEMU‚Ä¶,"I was very afraid of shopping at TEMU because of all the negative comments I've read about it, but I decided to give it a try. I tried and I was hooked. I was shopping almost every day. Not all the items were perfect, but every single time I complained to TEMU, they rectified it with a refund or credit towards my next purchase. Their customer service is better than the USPS, the DMV, etc. I purchased many good items, from clothes to tools to flowers, to figurines, to little things that would normally cost three times as much at the local stores. There is a problem with the Asian sizing, but mostly one gets the right size by looking at actual measurements which TEMU usually provides, instead of simply going by small, medium, large, etc. I bought some really good solar lights from TEMU. Once I found a good and reliable brand, I purchased ten of the same. The other solar lights I purchased were very small and some were dead on arrival, but like I said, TEMU rectified everything. I also asked TEMU to get rid of dishonest sellers because their reputation had improved so much, they could not afford to keep dishonest sellers or sellers that did not know what quality control was. The unfortunate thing is, as soon as the tariffs hit, TEMU's prices all went up. (Trump did his buddy, Bezos, a tremendous favor because TEMU took I think 70% of the Amazon shoppers, and I was one of those shoppers). The day the tariffs hit, everything at TEMU was advertised as ""local"" and ""no import charges"". Unfortunately, that is not true, especially that I am retired and I do nothing but cruise the TEMU website every single day. I see every little change. All the prices went up, obviously because of the tariffs. The other bad thing is the threshold to get free shipping is $30.00 PER SELLER, not from the entire TEMU website. One has now to buy two or ten of everything in order to reach that threshold. Yesterday, I had a pair of denim pants in my cart for $28.00. I would have to get two pairs in order to get free shipping or look for something else I could buy from ""the same seller"", and there was nothing else I wanted to buy, so I just deleted my order. I'd just as soon go to TJMaxx for about the same price and no shipping charges. I miss shopping at TEMU. I miss the convenience and the fun of it all. I used to shop every day. The day the tariffs hit and the prices went up plus the shipping charges became unavoidable, I hit the brakes. I haven't purchased anything from TEMU since. TEMU should at least give free shipping for a total purchase of $25.00 from any TEMU seller , otherwise, TEMU will not survive. Amazon gives free shipping for a total purchase of $35.00. TEMU can offer free shipping for a total purchase of $25.00 and it will keep TEMU in the competition. I don't think I need to shop for anything at TEMU again, but I will gladly shop again if they fix their free shipping threshold and become more competitive than they are now.6/1/25 -Addendum- I ordered three different kinds of saw from TEMU. A huge box arrived with a much smaller box inside. Inside that smaller box was the 18 inch saw I ordered. The other two were missing. I complained to TEMU and I was offered a refund which I took. Still bothersome that I ordered just three items and I get an update showing the three items were delivered, but two items were actually missing. Still, it is not a loss because TEMU gave me a refund for the missing items. 6/2/25- Addendum -I purchased a cherry tree ""seedling"" from TEMU in early April. The description also mentioned about it coming from a three year old tree. It seems to be more of a ""cutting"" than a seedling really. The ad showed a flourishing cherry tree with lots of fruits. It arrived later than the promised time frame. TEMU was great in sending me the $5 compensation for late delivery. When I finally got the cutting, I planted it and waited for it to show any signs of growth. Now, I have 24 fruit trees blooming and bearing fruits in my backyard. I know how to plant trees. This cherry cutting arrived with tiny buds which gave me hope it would grow into the beautiful cherry tree shown in the ad. I waited for a month. No growth signs. Two months later, the tiny buds were starting to fall off. I thought of waiting for another month because there was a 90 day return window, but the top of the cutting had discolored and looked dead. I decided to go ahead and asked for a refund. This was definitely a dud. The seller refused my refund request. TEMU allowing this seller to steal $27.00 from me is very unfair. What happened to the seller's 90 day return window? 6/3/25-Early this morning the two missing saws were delivered! Told TEMU to charge my credit card for them. Chat/AI keeps asking what my problem is.",2025-06-03T15:50:50.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for shopping with us and sharing your 5-star experience!

6411ee77ab0e5300139a331d,Mark,GB,7,1,Awful company,"Awful company, their items are very cheap and mediocre it's absolutely criminal! And I'm often left wondering why they haven't already been investigated and shutdown.Also, I had a problem with a merchant harassing me over a 1 star honest review I left them, reported it to Temu and they basically *Shrugged* and said send the item back for a refund, when the product absolutely stunk vile as i bought 2 100ml EDP bottles from Aroma Vault UK (On which Caution! And fair Warning! AVOID THEM!) , And when the merchant was making it difficult for me by not giving me a FREE return lable as it was LocalWarehouse purchase, they also allowed the merchant to not only be rude to me, but allowed the merchant to try blackmailing me for a exchange in me removing my review for a full refund, I have never experienced such unprofessional, rude, arrogant and non compassionate people in all my time shopping online!Temu says: (We recommend the best solution is to return the item back for a full refund)Are you seriously that incompetent? They failed to read the part that mentioned the seller being rude, manipulative and using blackmailing tatics to 1. LOW-ball me by (offering a ¬£5 refund for goods over ¬£40+! 2) Saying they will give me a full refund if I remove all my negative feedback (on which is pure black-mail) 3) Allowing the Merchant to talk to me in a unprofessional manner and violate several misconducts aswell as Temu guidelines.But after 3-4days backing and forthing with both Merchant and Temu Customer Support. Either of the two have failed to resolve this... especially Temu customer service! I provided them screenshots as evidence to my support claim to show the unprofessionalism from said merchant. AND TEMU JUST TURN A BliNDEYE!!Copying and pasting their pre written response scripts to me...Absolutely vile service!Honestly, I'm done with their app... they are getting no more money out of me.Absolutely disgusting company!I do not recommend, and avoid at all costs!Edit: As you can see through their response, they allegedly claim to follow ""protocols"" and ""care"" for their customers, all of which is complete lies!! And you have the audacity to ask me how I should recommend you how to 'improve"" you're service!? No thanks! I rather not do that, for if you fail to comprehend and acknowledge my current situation and fail to resolve that what chances are their listening to my ""Advice""?... Cheeky ain't even the word to describe these lot! But incompetent seems to ring true.Also, they did follow up regarding my issue, but still haven't resolved it to satisfactory standards!Therefore...My review will stick as it is indefinite!You had one chance with me and blew it!",2025-05-08T20:15:36.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

The delivery was very quick (under a week) but the items were all generally flimsy cheap plastic and just about worth the introductory price I paid (only about ¬£30). No way on earth would they be worth anything like what they claimed. I did expect this though as Temu has gamified the shopping experience and tries to tempt you to buy more Chinese plastic trash, shipping via air freight and helping to destroy the environment a little more.

They are not a trustworthy company. I also purchased an impact drill gun and they sent me a drill gun when I informed them day one that I never opened the box and I want to get the right item, they did not provide me with return shipping label.

They only deal with items that are not received and if they provide tracking, that‚Äôs good enough for them. They don‚Äôt get involved with refunds or return shipping labels I reach back out to Teo saying hey I received the item like I said it‚Äôs defective. The flagpole and the drill gun was never ordered. I ordered an impact gun. They said they were going to escalate the matter without any communication. I found out that this company is being sued in a class action lawsuit.

6000a8664896da00190dec2b,Daz,GB,55,2,Their still OK for some things but quality lets them down,"Whilst it's not advisable to trust anything remotely connected to the Chinese government or CCP which every company unfortunately is, I have none the less used Temu a few times for various things and whilst some bits were really handy and useful only due to price that sadly looks like its no longer the case now you can get some things cheaper on amazon or eBay that might be because the Chinese are diverting goods through other countries in a bid to bypass tariffs to reduce the cost in any way they can even some people selling selling electrical 110V lamps destined for the States on amazon UK market place knowing too well their not fit for purpose being wrong voltage!!!. such a shame the quality is so poor as there was some really impressive innovations going on over there I love their thinking :) really clever stuff but unfortunately the quality just let most things down again what a shame. As for returning goods whilst they say you can! they emphasise that your excuse for returning goods may effect if its accepted!!! I personally would not trust this offer it's vague at best and when I tried to start a return they tried to palm me off with a ¬£2.70 refund so I keep the items that cost me ¬£17 pound! like the ¬£2.70 would make the cheapness go away and make me feel better in keeping items I'm not happy with the quality!!! LOL it's such a pain that I can't be bothered to return them so I'll just bin them, Temu can keep the cash as it's probably my last time using you.again this is only a personal view through personal experience but I think I'll shop on a safer platform and pay the difference as china is getting dearer by the day and the quality still remains questionable but at least if purchased on amazon I can return without the fuss. Funny I'm waiting for some goods from Temu as I speak though its only been two weeks since ordering it, its apparently in Kazakhstan right now! must be using pony express :/.You can still get some handy stuff on Temu especially hand tools like carpentry bits but you have to be seriously selective in your choices and check it isn't already on eBay or Amazon first.",2025-05-03T15:24:32.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

I was going to rate a suitcase I got 3 stars because it looked like it had more metal in it than it did, but because I rated something else in my order first, it gave a both a higher rating. I'd go with what people say and not the stars. Also I don't really think Temu posts low reviews. You can't ask questions very well. While they say that you can return items, most of us aren't going to do that for a $5 item. I have bought several plastic items for the garden and had good luck with their bras and most of their tops. Clothes which aren't took form fitting are okay to buy. I bought a fleece wrap to wear on airplane trips that I would say was my best purchase. They keep offering these ""free"" things, I'm just not sure I'm getting any of them.

They confirmed they would refund 304,000 UZS to my original payment method. However, it's been more than two weeks and I have received nothing ‚Äî not to my card, not even to my Temu credit balance.Complaint Regarding Unreturned Credit Balance WithdrawalDear Temu Support,I am writing to formally raise a complaint regarding an unresolved issue with my credit balance. On April 13th, the amount of 304,000 UZS was withdrawn from my Temu credit balance, with the promise that it would be refunded to my primary payment method (my bank card).However, until now ‚Äî despite the time that has passed ‚Äî I have not received the refund. I‚Äôve contacted support multiple times, but instead of resolving the issue, I have received various inconsistent and misleading responses.This situation is highly disappointing and unprofessional. I trusted your platform, and I expect my money to be returned as promised. I kindly request that you immediately process the refund of 304,000 UZS to my bank card, and provide me with confirmation once it is completed.If this matter is not resolved soon, I will have no choice but to escalate the issue further.They keep responding with copy-paste messages, claiming the issue is being ‚Äúescalated‚Äù and asking me to ‚Äúwait 24 more hours‚Äù every time. Their refund receipt says the refund was done in March, which is a lie ‚Äî I only requested it in April! There is no record of any refund in my bank account. Even my bank confirmed they never received any funds from Temu.I have provided proof, contacted customer service multiple times, but Temu just keeps stalling. Their support tickets are useless and give no resolution. I‚Äôm now considering legal action and filing complaints through official consumer protection channels.Warning: Do NOT trust Temu with your money.

For me this counts as very deceitful and dishonest.29/04/2025Temu sells all sorts of items that you can imagine and some more.Most are very cheap and quality is poor or very poor, which makes total sense.The big, huge issue is the products description. Be very careful and read it thoroughly. Se all the images and measurements, read reviews and if it is too cheap even for Temu, check with the seller if the description is accurate.That has been my fight with them: I buy one thing, based on the description and when it arrives, it looks completely different, the materials are completely different, and so on. Be wary of the gifts with your purchase. You pay ¬£0 but most of them are utterly rubbish and again, completely different from what you see in their pictures, different materials and so on.

It said they will give me a coach. They did just that they text me a copy of their explanations of payments and how you would be paid as an employee salary and commission. But after working four days on the fourth day, the salary that was promised to me was not given to me because they withheld important information, which they knew if that was shared I would not have taken the position because you were offering me a job. Why would I pay you to work for you so they withheld information purposely not disclosing everything about the job that is dishonest and unfair to employees and I have an extensive amount of text messages because I never spoke with anyone over the phone. Everything is done through text. What‚Äôs up? Is the name of the communication piece that they use and I have been a big shopper of TEMU but as a shopper they offered rewards and promotions that they never honored.

Once I return everything I‚Äôve bought in the last three months, I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôll stick with reputable companies from now on. These people have shown themselves to be unprofessional and downright disrespectful.Date of experience: April 21, 2025Subject: Formal Complaint Regarding Harassment, Misconduct and Emotional Distress Caused by Temu Staff MemberDear Sir/Madam,I am writing to raise a formal complaint regarding the conduct of a member of your staff and the inadequate handling of my complaint by Temu UK. The events that have transpired have caused me significant distress, and I am now seeking urgent escalation and resolution.On [insert initial complaint date], I contacted Temu UK to raise a concern regarding inappropriate behaviour by one of your customer service agents. Rather than having my issue dealt with professionally, I have been subjected to what I believe to be targeted harassment and misconduct by this same staff member, resulting in emotional distress and mental exhaustion.Specifically:I have been forced to engage in over six hours of online chat in an attempt to resolve this matter, with no resolution.I have received more than 20 emails from the same individual, some of which have misrepresented their identity, using another name while their real name was still visible in the chat logs.This staff member has openly admitted to colleagues that they were using a false name and has mocked my complaints in internal communications that were later sent to me.Despite my efforts to report this misconduct, my complaint has been closed multiple times without proper investigation.The continued emails and failure to properly address this matter have left me feeling stressed, overwhelmed, and unwell.This behaviour is wholly unacceptable and appears to breach several standards under the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008, and may also constitute a breach of data protection principles if internal communications mocking my complaint were shared with or sent to me in error.I demand the following:1.

680d36ed5ad66527cc33bc02,Ramez Gaid,AE,1,1,‚ÄúTerrible Experience with Temu ‚Äî Ignored Rights and Faulty Product‚Äù,"Unfortunately, my experience with ‚ÄúTemu‚Äù was extremely disappointing. I purchased a bot through their online app, and upon receiving the product, I discovered it had a clear technical defect. Due to this technical defect, the bot was lost entirely after I was instructed by the company to return it. Even though I returned all the accessories related to the product (remote control, box, and packaging), I received no response from the company.Despite providing all the details regarding the defect and returning the accessories, Temu completely ignored my communications and failed to provide any logical or professional response. The service was far from professional, and it was clear that the company refused to acknowledge any fault or defect in the product.What was even more frustrating was the complete lack of response from customer service. They did not reply to my inquiries in any meaningful way, and when they did, the responses were extremely weak. In one of the replies, an employee even made a spelling mistake when writing the name of the company itself, which raises concerns about the level of professionalism within the company.If this is the level of service available, I would not recommend this company. The customer interaction was far from professional, and the services were not what one would expect from a company of this size.I hope these issues will be addressed in the future so that customers can have a better experience. At this point, it seems Temu needs significant improvements in their customer service processes and attention to product details.",2025-04-26T21:41:54.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

62d5b1883ffbd70012c1d356,Happily Nutz,MX,5,5,Thumbs Up!,"I genuinely like Temu. No, I'm not expecting designer products at cheap prices, but something simple and reasonably priced. I've gotten amazing deals on a lot of items and usually at about 1/3 the cost if I went online to a ""name"" company for the EXACT same thing. No, everything is not a gem. Some clothing is on the tacky/cheap side or isn't made for western height/weight ratios; some products break in shipping; and some items are just...well...strange. Here's what I've found: if I have an issue, Temu will issue a refund almost immediately, you just need to provide proof (a downloaded photo). Voila! I've returned very few items and have never had a problem. When ordering clothing, I look very carefully at the photo. I can usually tell if it's worth it or not. I've gotten some great walking clothing (bright, long-sleeved shirts, colorful leggings that make me smile, etc) and t-shirts with my favorite theme-dogs. I've found products that I never knew existed and others that made my daily life a lot easier. I get a kick just flipping through the pages and seeing what's out there. Yesterday, I was able to order something that ""Big Online Store"" has twice failed to send...and at less than half the price. Why wouldn't I use them again and again?

They should‚Äôve delivered it to apartment door and not leave in a location where 100s of tenants get a hold of it. They‚Äôre very terrible with updates on delivery notifications as well. Example, package alert comes up a hr or hrs later after the package has already been delivered. At that point, there‚Äôs the opportunity for the package to come up missing. Temu keeps asking the same stupid questions ‚Äúdid you check with neighbors and surrounding areas, if there‚Äôs still issues, feel free to contact us‚Äù. Stay clear from them as they thirsty as hell with sucking you into buying shit for cheap but when there‚Äôs a problem with deliveries, they don‚Äôt believe in assisting customers. I even offered an alternative address to ship items to a more private residence with family, they still refuse to assist with the reshipment on that part and don‚Äôt want to offer a try.

When i ask them to show me the proof they used in order to confirmed the item has indeed packed and shipped. They refused me! They could easily lied to customer by saying that. This is unfair because customers are always required to provide proof for Temu to confirm any issue, yet Temu refuses to show any proof they have to prevent potential fraud on their side.-------------------------------------------1.

Yet Temu keeps insisting the item is complete. That‚Äôs dishonest and unacceptable.2. The foldable storage arrived without the magnet and handle. The magnet is supposed to keep the storage box closed, and the handle is there to help users open it easily. Without both, the storage box stays open and can't function properly as intended. It's incomplete and not usable as a proper foldable storage solution.Then Temu had the nerve to say the item was ""checked according to their standards.""

64f6446e858e7c00128d602c,Bella,AU,7,1,Appalling lack of Customer care for Temu's Customer,"An update to the below. I lodged a dispute with PayPal and I was advised to send the parcel back to an address in Parramatta NSW. I called PayPal prior to sending it to query the address as it wasn't the address that that returns usually go to and the Consultant advised this is the address provided by Temu. I sent it back to that address and provided photos of the parcel showing the address and the tracking ID. It was delivered and I advised PayPal it was delivered and the time. I got another email today from PayPal saying they want more info as Temu claim they haven't received it. I provided screenshots of the email I received from Australia Post as well as the delivery status on Australia Post's website showing it was delivered. This is appalling. They just don't want to refund the money for THEIR MISTAKE. Steer clear of this company.Further to my review below, the second request for a refund has also been denied. I dont know if this is a person denying it or a robot. It's appalling. Temu responded and provided a link to get further assistance and it took me to the website. Not anywhere for live chat or any other complaints department. Don't know if that also was a robot or human but whatever, it's a joke and their lack of customer support is pathetic. If I could give them 0 stars I would. See my original review below. I placed an order for 2 WHITE 5 drawer plastic cabinets. The order was split into 2 deliveries. One of the cabinets is white and the other was black, grey, orange, yelliw and white drawer fronts. I requested a refund and it was denied, stating the delivery was correct. I was outraged as I provided a photo clearly showing the coloured drawer fronts. I re-requested the refund and provided more pics showing the difference between the two. It's still under review. I went to their complaints section on the website and voiced my anger. I am not stupid. How can they possibly say the correct item was delivered? How is grey, black, orange and yellow WHITE???? The order clearly shows I ordered 2 WHITE cabinets. The boxes may be the same but the contents are different. Whoever made that decision, is a lazy moron and obviously didn't look at the pics, and should be sacked. I placed the order in good faith and I expect Temu to do the right thing by me. These were expensive and are crap for the price so its double the anger to be denied a refund for the wrong item that is crap. If I get a refund after my second request for a refund, I'll come back and edit my review. If they don't then I'll be disgusted with the lack of customer care.",2025-05-08T09:14:53.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us. We are sorry for any inconvenience caused.

I love you, Temu, and I'll have to buy myself a new wardrobe, because I can't fit a lot of my stuff anymore...lol. I saw that people write badly about the customer service.

It does take a week or so for delivery, but then i suppose that is reflected in the price. However, i'm careful what I order as returns are not like Amazon. Yesterday I was sent the wrong item, plus another item did not work how i thought it would, and a clothing item was too small. I wanted a refund and replacement for the wrong item, and was checking if possible to return the other items. I was offered a partial refund, which amounted to about 30% of the price of the wrong item. After protesting on their online chat, they gave me a full refund, which came through instantly by way of a credit (my choice). They would have a 5* star rating if say only charged AED20 to return an item if did not fit. Then I would chance order more clothes from them.",2025-04-18T18:28:24.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for shopping with us and sharing your 4-star experience! We are glad you found some items you love.

I kindly urge you to re-open the case and ensure it is thoroughly reviewed by a responsible and unbiased team.I am still requesting a refund and will consider escalating this issue to external consumer protection platforms if no fair resolution is reached.I am writing once again regarding my order PO-014- 20223186094630437 and the ongoing issue of the undelivered package. While I appreciate the efforts of your team, I would like to address some crucial points that remain unresolved, based on the evidence I have already provided.No Signature on the Online Receipt:1. The online receipt does not have my signature. There are two signature sections, one for the seller and one for the buyer, but my signature is missing in the buyer's section, which clearly indicates that the2. Courier's SMS Instructions:The courier company sent me an SMS instructing me to pick up the package from a specific location, not my home address. This is inconsistent with the delivery claim shown in the online receipt, which states that the package was delivered to my home address.3. Delivery Address Discrepancy:The address shown in the online receipt as the delivery address is my home address, but the SMS from the courier clearly directed me to go to a different address. This indicates that the package was not delivered to my home.4. Previous Communication with Temu:After I contacted Temu regarding these discrepancies, I was informed that the package was sent to my address after 24 hours of investigation. However. I believe this conclusion is based on a misinterpretation of the evidence, as the provided proof clearly shows the package was never delivered to my home.Given these clear inconsistencies, I would like to request that you revisit the case and review the evidence thoroughly. It is clear that the package was never delivered to me, and I still request a refund.

I recently used a $5 coupon (minium of $5.01 purchase whtout any other stipulations) on a single item purchase without any issue. After 30minutes, decided to cancel the order. Was told I can re-use the $5 coupon,but I need to spend at least $30 of purchase in order to proceed with checkout. Temu uses ample of bait-n-switches scams, so be FOREWARNED! Another bait-n-switches example in temu app: item listed low price, but as soon added to shopping-cart, price increased higher immediately.Purchase Order; PO-211-19344387994153339 (this order was made today and I canceled immediately after 30minutes)Update: 4-18-25 after I wrote this review, temu requested my personal info (full name, phone number and order num) in which I provided.

However, I STILL have major concern with GOFO EXPRESS courier...I have never seen so many negative and bad reviews on Gofo Express and I am very concerned. I have SIX ORDERS from Temu and these orders will likely use GOFO Express courier to deliver these items. My house has FOUR 4K security cameras pointing at the front yard and at the door main entrance...will see if Gofo Express will attempt to do any deceiveful delivery.

60fa880b564b2c0012ab748c,Ken Harrow,GB,28,1,A very devious website,"99% of the time, I give good reviews because I like to encourage people and businesses that have been a blessing to me.Sadly, that is not the case with Temu.When anybody visits the Temu website, they get the impression that, as with every other website, they can purchase the item that they want at the price on the website. I chose the item that I wanted and placed it in the cart as usual.Then, when I came to checkout, up pops a statement that 'Temu will not process orders under ¬£15' along with some items that could be added to make up that amount.I have spoken with Temu about this previously but they are still continuing with the practice.They wait until their customer has made the decision to purchase an item before trying to con that customer into - either into spending more than they wished/intended - or having to start all over again to purchase that item elsewhere.I consider this to be, at the very least, extremely unprofessional but it is also a very devious ploy.One alternative for a customer would be to purchase a second item then return it and get the money back although, no doubt, Temu will have another way round this.Temu should either inform the prospective customer in their advertisements that nothing costing under ¬£15 can be purchased on its own.Temu should get an award for the most devious website.I was pleased to receive a response from Temu who promised to look into this. As I mentioned I had taken the time to phone Temu but nothing was changed then. I would repeat my suggestion that Temu should be upfront about this (in all advertising) - On their website, there is not just a request that 'any additional items should be ordered at the same time - 'There is a demand at AT CHECKOUT that whatever the customer wants they cannot order through them unless they spend at least ¬£15. The result would be heavier 'unwanted' parcels going through the postal system. I haven't come across any other website with this policy. I left my items in the basket because I had no intention of spending ¬£15 when the items I wanted cost ¬£7.99 - I haven't got ¬£7 to spend on things that are not a priority to me.",2025-04-17T10:06:12.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for your valuable feedback.

636d1e1ecae5f40011847d65,NN,FR,79,1,Ridiculous Website & App - Full of Fake Promises.,"I bought ball bearings marketed for ""industrial machinery"" which should have been extremely strong. The size was 6.35mm which are used in bike wheels which is what I used them for.After 3.6 miles (measured on my bikes odometer), the front wheel suddenly went very tight as though the brakes were sticking, and then a loud snapping sound which was the quick release which held the wheel on. This all happened in literally 2 seconds, so I had no time to brake and come to a safe stop.Once the quick release snapped, the wheel became very loose, causing me to lose control of the bike and crash. Fortunately I landed on the grass verge and did not end up in the road as I would have ended up hurting myself on tarmac, or even worse getting hit by a vehicle.There is no option to contact the seller of the ball bearings through Temu website, so I emailed them directly on 2 occasions using the email address on their company details, but they've not responded.I also reported this issue to Temu 7 days ago, informing them I need to make a claim for damages as the product failed, and I made it very clear I use my bike nearly daily so it needs to be resolved ASAP, but every time I ask for an update, they always say they are looking into it.-----Tonight when I signed in to the app I had the cup and ball game to get rewards, then I had the option to redeem further coupons.

They just use a cheap company to deliver now. they will not refund me or resin the parcel, so now I lost a lot of money and no orders..The absolute BEST joke of all this, they asked me to send pictures to prove I didn‚Äôt receive the parcel, so i sent SEVEN pictures of the areas around, clearly showing no parcel. They then sent MY pictures back to me saying the courier sent them to Temu as ‚Äòproof of delivery‚Äô?! ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIC CUSTOMER SERVICE. Best part is, I opened a PayPal case to dispute. Temu helpline told me to close it so they can proceed with refund. Well of course that didn‚Äôt happen - Temu claim the case is still open, but it‚Äôs been closed a week now so they are still LYING.

67f9a328fa4006636f934a53,Kimberly Fleck,US,2,1,This is lengthy but please read because‚Ä¶,"This is lengthy but please read because I need help!!! I ordered 4 packs of 1 item. I received 2. Chatted & called & they asked 4 a pic of missing items??!! Also during this time I ordered some soap dishes & FedEx shows they were delivered to a different person & signed for. I chatted & called & they refused refund bcz they showed delivered even after providing info from FedEx. It was 17.66. Between the two requests it was 25.00! I spent over 25 hours between calls and chats! I never end chats so it‚Äôs all one long one. I spoke to over 11 senior specialists and over 18 agents. I filed a dispute with PayPal & several senior specialists said if I cxld dispute, I would get refunded. Now they still won‚Äôt refund any of the 2 claims. After about 10 days they came back & said that there was a problem with me not getting the 4 items & refunded me 8.22. But they still refuse to credit balance or refund the 17.66. Now I am getting harassed by 2 agents sending me numerous emails daily about 2 tickets that they say I am claiming missing products and the 2 orders have just cleared customs. So now it looks like I am just calling & opening claims for everything. I spoke to my SIL who is a lawyer & because I asked on many occasions to stop emailing me, that this is bordering on harassment. I also told him that they say their calls are recorded and I did Csr Srvs for 30+ years & if a customer requested a copy we had to provide it. So this last agent KIT claimed she was the highest senior agent & that she could not provide me with the recordings of the calls since February when they started denying me anything and taking away any opportunities for promos& games. She also said that she did not have an address 4 executive complaints bcz they don‚Äôt have any office like that. I know 17.66 is literally nothing to spend the amount of time with this, but it‚Äôs the principle. I can‚Äôt even get price adjustments on my accounts anymore. They took away my Temu points so all I have is FARMLAND AND TEMU CIRCLE!! I want to know why some people are getting refunded & being told to keep the item. Or if they have a problem, they are getting refunds immediately. I‚Äôm thinking that they have my account flagged. I don‚Äôt ask for refunds. I have only had 2 issues with them since I have been using them and both times after fighting with them for days, on both accounts they came back and admitted they were wrong and fixed the issue. Then this week I returned a lot of items. The denied 2 refunds because they couldn‚Äôt find the items in the bag. So, I went around with them for a couple days and it was a total of 3.58$. Again principle. Then I see on my account that says 25 items returned and then I clicked on the return package where it shows everything that was in the package. There were 25 items including the 2 they insisted were not returned. So, they gave me my refund. I shouldn‚Äôt have to deal with this or be treated like this and when I did customer service and they wanted a refund for a small amount, it was cheaper to give them the refund than to sit there and pay me 40.00 bucks an hour to sit there and fight with the customer. I can only imagine what these agents cost Temu to invest over 20 hours to just keep denying me a 17.66 refund. My question is, how do I get a copy of the recordings & how to I get an address to write to? Anyone have any advice? I‚Äôm tired of spending the amount of money I do on a weekly basis only to be treated like this. I appreciate any and all who read this far.

Every few weeks now, I have to waste time with the limited resources that I have to scour through Temu's website and report sellers who have shamelessly stolen my work to try and profit for themselves. Temu claim that they 'vet' their sellers. But clearly they do not, and they just respawn and do the same thing over and over again.

Firstly one order was never delivered even though the courier company said they made 3 attempts ( I have doorbell cam and surveillance from the store across the street proving they didn't make even one attempt) Secondly the orders I did receive were junk (no surprise but thought I'd try) Temu offers free returns except they don't have a return carrier available near me, it would cost 10 dollars in an Uber there and 10 back to return less than 10 dollars worth of garbage. Customer service, I say laughingly because it definitely is was not customer service,was deplorable and robotic.

If you‚Äôre not careful you could rack up a lot of shipping fees on ‚Äòlocal‚Äô items. If a company is using the site the shipping should be free. And, the ‚Äúfree‚Äù items are a scam. It‚Äôs never free. Free 4 gifts would cost at least $220 bc the requirement is usually a $55 purchase for each gift on 4 consecutive days. I wasn‚Äôt aware of the scam and thought my gifts were lost in transient. Nope, paid $55 plus tax and additional shipping on 1 item and didn‚Äôt get a single free gift. Disappointing. Also, I‚Äôve ordered the same product a couple times. The second order was of lesser quality each time.

It does take a while for the delivery to come but for me it's no problem because you can get many things that you won't get anywhere else in UK. At the time I am writing this review, I already had about 10 deliveries from Temu, all within the estimated time with no problems, no missing or damaged items. All items received were excellent quality for the price. I even returned items in value of about ¬£80 because I got the size wrong for shoes, clothing and others. I have received the refund on my card in about 7 days with no exception. For some low value items I have opted for refund in credit into Temu account which I received in seconds without the requirement to return the items. I haven't returned anything due to quality issues. So far, I have ordered items in value of a couple of hundred pounds. I found products made based on ingenious ideas which I didn't come across anywhere else. I found products of the same quality as from Amazon, but at least twice cheaper. So, it all makes sense. Amazon delivers lightning fast but you pay for it. To be honest, in purchase value, I haven't purchased from Amazon in 6 months as much as I have purchased from Temu in one month. And to be honest again, I have started buying from Temu, not necessarily because of the price, but mostly because of the novelty, brilliant ideas and beautiful design products. I don't know where the negative reviews come from, but I am really impressed with Temu. For me, it's worth the waiting for delivery for what you get. For example, I got some bifocal reading glasses from Specsavers for over ¬£100. That is the pay for their staff pampering you and dancing around you. I got same strength glasses from Temu which look better and they are foldable, much more practical and convenient for about ¬£5. Unbelievable. My Specsavers glasses are forgotten somewhere around the house and Temu ones are on the job. Even the delivery way is better than Amazon. The courier knocks on the door and if nobody home, it will leave it with neighbours. Amazon courier got bit lazy, if you are not at home, they just drop it in front of your door, take a photo and go. Sometimes, they don't even knock or ring the bell. Recently, I have got a smart ring from Temu which costs around ¬£20. Branded ones are in the range of hundreds. It works as it should. The app on the phone is quick in syncronising and simple to use. I have washed my hands with the smart ring on many times without any problems. Never had any problems with Temu orders.",2025-04-05T03:49:43.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for shopping with us and sharing your 5-star experience! We are happy that you are pleased with your items.

5926b3200000ff000a9c3ca7,Theo B,GB,8,1,Allows other people to use your email address,"Some random person has set up a scam Temu account using my email address. It looks like a classic fake review situation - an item ordered for 1p to some UK address. I never verified this email, and the email account itself is secure with all sorts of 2FA and a strong password and no sign of unauthorised access. You would think that if someone did not verify the email they signed up with, they would not be able to create an account and order. However, some weeks later I start getting emails that this account *has* been set up and someone has ordered something with it. I have contacted Temu about this and they are just taking me in circles, I have been emailing them for days and they just keep telling me to log into the account to unlink my email.I've tried explaining it is not my account, it's a scam account, it's an unauthorised use of my email etc and it is falling on deaf ears. They suggested I just reset 'my' password but I can't because there is a 2FA phone number on this account. Surely if an email address has *never* been verified their system should acknowledge a request from the exact same email address asking to be removed? Why can no-one work this out? Why do they allow orders and 2FA to be set up for an email address that was never verified? Why was there no email notification that 2FA was set up etc?Surely this is a widespread issue with all the fake reviews, why do they have no idea how to do anything about it?Edit: just look at the reply as to how little they care - my complaint is that the normal support process doesn‚Äôt work.

But my sister kept turning up to family events in these great tops she said she'd bought from temu and so I got curious. Since dipping my toe in the temu app, I have to concede I have only had positive experiences. I have stuck with clothing only, at least for now, beginning with a few nighties because I thought if they arrive and it's obvious I wasted my money then lesson learned and no real harm done. But I loved the nighties! Although the fabric is a little thin, they are so colourful and comfy and they wash pretty well too. So then I tried a few tops and blouses for work. Again, no issues. The quality is actually pretty reasonable (thinner fabric though and may need ironing once washed) and the range and variety are impressive. Prices are low and there are often offers of further discounts once items are in your cart. Delivery is pretty quick as well. I really don't have anything to complain about. All my orders have arrived and I'm enjoying wearing the clothes I've purchased. Temu is ok I think.

67ef01e189ee140a1e553559,Marc Barnes,US,2,1,Sometimes the laughs you get from a failure are worth much more than the money,"First off, this isnt an actual review of TEMU but for one of the products it represents, i think is called zsrxmotion sporting goods. But For 9 bucks, what should I expect? I wasnt expecting a competive top of the line set of darts when i saw them. I was looking for a cheap, different barrel type and weight for practice. I know there were many other, much cheaper options, but none of them were electroplated in Candy apple red. When I received them, At first glance, the moment i opened the package, i laughed pretty hard. I couldnt wait to show my dart buddies later. That evening I presented the Darts in all their Red glory. After a roar of laughter and about 30 minutes of clowning my match began. In the very first game, during the First throw, the needle on my second dart tip broke. After even a much bigger laugh, we paused the game and without an extractor tool we figured out how to remove the tip and reinsert the leftover tip back into the barrel and continued the game. Prior to the game I opted for the shorter secondary ""nylon"" shafts provided. Although my accuracy was not as precise as usual, I was surprisingly pleased with my performance in the match at this point as i had a commanding lead heading into the 15s . 1st dart 15, second dart 15, 3rd dart 15. but the flight fell out and as I went to reinsert it the shaft had split broken.. more laughter... I replaced it with an integrated and continued. My next few throws were off, missing the bullseye by cms but eventually I easily won that particular match. Later I had to replace a second shaft that broke as well. All in all I bought them to test different weights and barrel configuration. My skill won the game but the pure comedy of these darts made the night. i would have paid 100 bucks for the entertainment but instead I paid less than 10 bucks for a great memory. Thank you Funny Dart company for the laughs and great April fools joke. Oh.. and I don't recommend these darts, unless you like the color red and you need a good laugh. i wish I had video. The 5 star rating is for the experience and pleasure. the Darts themselves, although functional to a point, get a ZERO star rating. I didn't realize they sold single use darts, kind of like a condom. 1 star.",2025-04-04T03:06:12.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for shopping on Temu!

They promised me $100 cashback if I earn 100 tokens, yeah I spent like $10 and got 97 tokens already and what's next, I need to spend $300+ dollars to get the remaining 3 tokens as it is a pyramid scheme with lower rewards the closer you get to actually getting the reward.

Messages are unclear and chaotic, and there‚Äôs no reminder about the final day to pick up your package. This lack of transparency is unacceptable for a modern delivery service.Adding to my frustration, I spent two hours in the chat trying to retrieve my package, but Temu‚Äôs rigid policy wouldn‚Äôt allow me to resolve the issue.

59bfd01e0000ff000aca8dd0,Rudolf Berki,GB,33,1,This is the worst e-commerce platform‚Ä¶,"This is the worst e-commerce platform with the lowest rating I have ever joined, but this is the first and last order, and no more. On 30 March 2025, I purchased (or at least I tried to purchase) a kerosene stove and paid ¬£55 through PayPal. The next day, on 31 March 2025, I received an email from PayPal saying that I received a refund from temu.com. Not knowing what happened and why, I have contacted Temu Customer Service on the same day (31 March 2025) to find out as to why my order was cancelled and the money refunded. To my astonishment, they said, I quote,""We regret to inform you that your order ‚Ä¶ has been refunded due to unusual payment activity. We kindly suggest trying an alternative payment method to proceed with your transaction.""I found it terribly disappointing. I paid with PayPal, but they then refused it ""due to unusual payment activity"", which could not be farther from the truth. Fortunately, I paid with PayPal, which is a reputable and secure online payment system that I used for about ten years, or else they would have screwed me. In my opinion, this is the reason why they suggested an alternative payment method, which probably would have caused me a headache to sort out and get a refund, but they could not screw PayPal.Reading the reviews of this platform on Trustpilot, I am utterly shocked, but thankfully I am not a victim. It would have been even more shocking if I were to lose money. It's worth reading the reviews, so I am really thankful to Trustpilot for running a review website where scammers and indecent platforms can be identified. There are many scammers out there these days, so I am now vigilant.",2025-04-01T17:26:20.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us. We are sorry for any inconvenience caused.

I would appreciate getting my money back. Thank you!I purchased a few high-priced items from TEMU, but not all of them were delivered, and TEMU has not refunded me.I had a very troubling experience with LIFEIDEAS. The LUNO delivery man left my parcel in an insecure location, which led to it being stolen by the LIFEIDEAS delivery man when he came to my house to deliver my sofa. I was not at home at the time. He noticed a parcel from LUNO (a mattress) in my hallway, falsely claimed it belonged to LIFEIDEAS, and took it. My neighbour witnessed this; the driver was in a white pick-up van with the registration KV69 ZNS. When the driver returned to deliver the sofa, I confronted him, and he apologised, claiming he had taken the mattress to the LIFEIDEAS warehouse.I do not trust these companies; I believe LIFEIDEAS is a thief, and TEMU and LUNO will not take responsibility for stolen items. I strongly advise against using their services unless you want to risk having your hard-earned money taken from you.

This is perplexing, as I have been raising these concerns for the past six months. I have requested that Temu use an alternative delivery service for my orders, but their responses have been clich√© apologies.They continue to insist on using Evri for my deliveries, which then necessitates me spending at least three to four hours tracking down my purchased items. I am thoroughly fed up with the difficulties in receiving my deliveries; it is truly exasperating. While the overall Temu experience is excellent, it is significantly undermined by the poor choice of Evri as their delivery partner in England.

They keep saying tracking shows item delivered to correct address, when it was delivered to a door step at that address, within view of all passers by. So anyone could have took it, including the delivery driver. But Temu ask for prooof it was taken by sending them cctv footage. Not everyone has cctv footage. It should be down to the sender, which in this case is Temu, that the parcel was delivered to the person at the address, and not left on a doorstep. They even said they have a signature of someone signing for the parcel, but when I ask for this, they do not mention it, as I know it wasn‚Äôt signed for at my address as I live alone, so what every signature they claim they have is not from the household of the address they say accepted it. Why do delivery drivers even leave parcels on doorsteps? They might has well just give it away, as taking a photo of an item left outside a front door, is not proof the item was delivered to the person at that address.I‚Äôm sure Temu will respond to this gain with a generated reply saying we will do all we can, when in fact they won‚Äôt do anythingDo not trust Temu they don‚Äôt care about customers and never let you call them or call you back when they ask for your number.

I have got nothing but praise for this companyI started using them a few years ago, I‚Äôve bought just a couple dresses the first time I was extremely impressed, I‚Äôve washed them. I‚Äôve worn them. They‚Äôve dried within 20 minutes and I get quite a lot of comments. I don‚Äôt understand why the reviews are so bad. I order roughly ¬£20-¬£50 worth each time and if there‚Äôs anything ever wrong I can return the item on occasions when I‚Äôve not been happy with something they‚Äôve told me to keep it and they still give me a refund. I don‚Äôt know any company that would do that. I find their dresses beautiful they‚Äôre long their floaty for the money. I get more compliments on their stuff than I do my expensive stuff so all I can say is for me, I‚Äôve not had a problem and I‚Äôve got many many dresses. I‚Äôve just ordered another parcel with six dresses come to 50 quid You can‚Äôt beat it and they do look amazing. I get many comments. I‚Äôm sorry if you disagree. I‚Äôve bought for my my holiday which I won‚Äôt just wear just yet.I‚Äôve returned maybe five things in the whole term that I‚Äôve been buying stuff that‚Äôs how impressed I am. I‚Äôve bought a blanket with bichon frize on it. I‚Äôve bought a little clip that holds my hat on the bag. I‚Äôve ordered another clip that goes on the suitcase to hold your coat or cardigan. I‚Äôve ordered some caps. I‚Äôve ordered lights for the garden. I‚Äôve shoehorns the long ones cause I hurt my leg recentlyI‚Äôve bought some little metal posters for the garden so you can see by what I‚Äôm saying. I‚Äôve bought an awful lot. I bought a couple of micro towels for my holiday because they don‚Äôt take up much room I bought a lead for the dog. I wasn‚Äôt particularly happy with that but they refunded it. I bought a pair of shorts but because my arse look fat but they still refunded it so I‚Äôve only got good things to say about them I‚Äôd give them 5 out of 5.",2025-03-30T22:52:28.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for shopping with us and sharing your 5-star experience!

67e7740f257601f4e98f5f1b,TEMU VICTIM,US,1,1,Nightmare on TEMU Street!,"The item sold to us: Two defective rubberwood barstools. The problem: The chairs were victims like us from an obvious lack of quality control at the high volume factory, with no actual visual inspection, and ditto at the Temu warehouses. Right out of the box, after opening the carton to remove the parts, sharp splinters of wood mixed with the packaging penetrated like quills penetrating my skin. I recoiled but not before the broken edges of a bolted cross brace cut my fingers. (See photos) My fingers had to be treated and lightly bandaged. The splinters had to be removed carefully. My husband had to help with my cuts and then he cautiously took photos of some of the broken pieces. My husband who knows furniture well examined the whole mess further. The back rests were warped from lack of proper aging of the rubberwood laminates. Rubberwood has high sap content and needs to be aged properly to remove unwanted moisture. Otherwise, you get warping and even bleeding of the wood if damaged. My husband continued to examine the pieces. Critical bolt mounts and holes would not align as a result of the improper aging or drying. The bolt mounts were scored into the warped back rests making assembly totally impossible. The bolts were too far out of alignment to connect the parts. Center braces of each chair came bolted for shipping, which were too cracked and unsafe to use.Imagine the horror of splinters of wood in your own fingers. And blood on your skin and jeans to round out this review. My husband worked in a furniture factory so has experience and firsthand knowledge of construction and assembly. We have both tried unsuccessfully for three weeks to alert Temu of the safety issues and get a refund. I will end this part of the review with one word, NIGHTMARE. This Temu furniture jack-in-the-box sprung a bad dream on us. But the nightmare had only just begun! Everything that was wrong with the chair was true about Temu customer service! We encountered fragmented help. No part knew the other part. Splintered conversations. We experienced misaligned customer service representing the vendor who blamed us. (""Human error."") ""We won't replace the item"" and offered a few bucks in consolation instead. Then the nightmare got worse, darker. Broken promises. ""Yes, dear customer, we will resolve this. We understand your deep suffering and frustration."" But instead of getting a replacement or a refund from Temu customer service, we went in circles getting nowhere. That is what Temu Circle Members pay for? A runaround! Even Temu customer service couldn't deal with this nightmare because their unvetted vendor actually sold broken chairs, which caused real physical injury. I feel sorry for their inability to just simply issue a refund. They kept promising, but their words were twisted. Amazon would have refunded it. And to compound matters, the box and packaging came torn, broken, in pieces, not usable for a return. UPS would not accept. Plus, warehouse inspectors could be injured, as well, hands blindly inspecting. Even possible wood splinters in the eyes, God forbid! My husband suffered a corneal laceration from fine wood debris getting in his right eye. It was red and tender like something was in the eye for days just from moving the stool parts to the garage and covering the broken parts with heavy plastic. For us, who are paying ""Temu Circle Members"", I guess you get what you pay for. We have been running in circles for weeks. It's been Catch 22 and DeJa'Vu over and over again. Think about the situation. What is wrong with this picture? It is not an isolated experience for us and so many others.Questions to consider. Is TEMU selling a lot of products to the US that would have been rejected under real quality control in China? Does TEMU consciously make it so frustrating to get a refund that you simply just give up trying? Is that the model? See our review on TEMU with the ""bloody photos."" Search for the item number and vendor. This is a real encounter with TEMU and not for the faint of heart.Item# KP1069452.

I can therefore only praise this company as efficient and professional and basing my review on my experience i would recommend them. My order was well packed and protected too and i am very happy with my purchase and would possibly order again sometime in the future.Thank you so much Temu for making my first time ordering with your company an enjoyable experience.",2025-03-28T00:44:58.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for shopping with us and sharing your 5-star experience!

You have to work harder to get your free gifts and I've had loads, ordering one every day seems daft as they post them each time rather than store them up and ship as a one lot.I had a refund without return for a broken item just sent a photo on the return form.Generally its ok i often check between eBay Amazon and often find the same item on Temu at a lower price.Find the messaging of offers annoying so just delete many of them as there often so complicated to get the discount in-terms of spend, think they have been working on perfecting the shopping with major discounts on items if you spend a certain amount, before you know your house is full of useless stuff that might come in handy one day.üòÇIt can become addictive looking for the elusive bargain of the century.Remember the old saying from US marketing in the 60‚Äôs, ‚Äúsell them hopes and dreams and ship them shit‚Äù.",2025-03-28T00:06:53.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

When you are offered credit it will be in parts, for each part you have to spend certain money in order to use that credit. For example I was offered credit of 30¬£ if I spend 40¬£. As a naive person I spent 40¬£. And Temu offered me credit of 30¬£ as 0.7¬£, 0.7¬£, 3¬£,6¬£ 7.5¬£ ....=30¬£ so for each credit like 0.7¬£ you should spend again at least 15¬£ to use your 0.7¬£ credit , so in order to use your all 30¬£ credit you have to use at least 300¬£. Very clever Chinese, I won't trust it and the price of product are almost same as Amazon, with Temu there is no return for your money they will make millions of excuse in order to avoid refund.with Amazon at least you are safe",2025-03-27T19:16:38.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

The products are mostly good quality, only a couple which were poor quality. It can be difficult to buy clothes online as sizes can be hard to determine. Household products have all been good, including the resin and contact adhesives.Delivery times from UK suppliers is quite quick, a couple of days to a week, but usually add a small charge for delivery. Those sent from China do take a while, but if they are travelling by ship that is to be expected.Some people have warned that they install spyware with their app. That has not been my experience, unlike Facebook and the other big social media companies who I steer clear of.

66927507b8e53d931b99e045,Michelle Neal,US,3,1,I purchased a Hermitlux counter top‚Ä¶,"I purchased a Hermitlux counter top dishwasher on March 8, 2025 for $170 based on a sale. Item was supposed to be shipped locally meaning based in the US. Item was supposed to be delivered no later than March 18th. They provide tracking information and according to UPS Hermitlux was supposed to ship item but they only printed a label. On March 17th I reached out to both Temu and Hermitlux to inquire why item still hadn‚Äôt shipped. I got apologies and Hermitlux responded by email that it was UPS fault saying they didn‚Äôt pick up item. On March 17 UPS said item had ‚Äúarrived in CA‚Äù and they finally shipped the item. UPS said it was coming from Barron Consulting LLC which from Google doesn‚Äôt even appear to be a real company. I contacted Temu with concerns that this item was NOT in stock in the US but was really being shipped from China. They insisted it was an item based locally but couldn‚Äôt explain why item ‚Äú arrived‚Äù in CA where it was supposed to ship from. I finally received this dishwasher on March 24th. You can manually add water to the top ( it requires THREE 1.8 liters of water to start running. Well, after it started the wash cycle it flooded my kitchen with water SPILLING OUT OF THE BOTTOM PANEL . I had to grab bath towels to cover my kitchen floor while I ran to unplug this unit with my feet in water! I contacted Temu they wanted video proof! Like I‚Äôm going to risk being electrocuted and start this machine again so more water can spill over my counter and unto my floor. Now I have to return this crap. I also contacted Hermitlux and they said it happened because of ‚Äú violent transportation‚Äù by the shipping company! They are supposed to pack this item for transport! Now I have to ship this crap back while my $170 remains in limbo. But get this, I looked for a plate or sticker with a serial number to have them check to make sure I wasn‚Äôt sent a damaged or returned unit and item has NO sticker NO plate nothing with a serial number or model number or electric voltage information! I have no idea how they were even able to sell this item in the US! Buyer beware.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-////Reply to Temu 3/26/25 you should have no problem finding my order. It was placed on March 8, 2025 for the Hermitlux Counter Dishwasher. As already stated I have had extensive conversations with your customer service department regarding this matter. I have also started the return process and UPS will pick up package on Saturday then it will probably take you 2 weeks or more to issue my refund. How you can sell an electronic item with no model number, serial number or electric voltage/ watt is shocking and suspect illegal and not allowed in the US.,RETURN UPDATE 3/29/25 ‚Äî//////Temu scheduled a pick up with UPS to retrieve this malfunctioning dishwasher for today 8-12pm . I got a UPS tracking number and confirmation of scheduled pick time etc from Temu . Guess what they never scheduled any pickup! I called UPS after no one arrived and they said Temu ‚Äúpaid‚Äù for a pickup but scheduled NOTHING! So, if item is not received back by April 7,2025 I lose my $170. Pretty slick on Temu‚Äôs part . I contacted Temu again and asked for a supervisor which was refused. Shady company. Back to shopping ONLY with online US companies like Amazon.

602c7ee0b9d941001aef611f,Urban,US,3,1,Trouble in Temuland,"Full Disclosure: Up to this point I have loved my experiences with Temu. I have found items I needed for resonable prices and customer service felt so much easier than Amazon plus the associates were nice.This was my first issue with the platform after 3 months of using it.Temu did not return my money even after I returned the items and asked for the funds to be returned to my original form of payment which was my card.Initially, Temu was a last resort when looking for items I couldn't find in store or for reasonable prices with other online retailers. I was pleasantly surprised when I began.I felt Temu was great. I found a number of items I liked. Really cool off the beaten path items as well as some awesome clothing pieces. At first the purchasing and return process easy, I thought this was beneficial considering that sometimes items were not as they appeared in pictures, which happens with online purchases. Most recently, in two separate orders I ordered a pair of jeans and I received a pair of circa 1970s polyester pants and my second order had several items I was returning.The first order I just needed to return the pants, the second order, I asked for a full return and I would return the items. The Temu customer service associate said: ""I found a way you don't have to return the items. You don't have to worry about the trouble of returning them."" Not really a problem but ok. The associate seemed insistent I not worry about returning the products. I was asked how I wanted my funds returned. I said in the original payment. I was told it may take a few days (7-14) before it showed up with my banking institution. I waited. The money never showed up. In the in-between time Temu refused to issue a return label for the pants (Temu prides itself on trouble free returns) and then the returned funds for the other order showed up... as credit in my Temu account. I contacted them again and told customer service the issue with shipping and the return. I spent almost 2 hours in a chat explaining and re-explaining the situation (it's all documented in the chat): that I never asked for Temu credit. The issue was escalated for them to tell me that they can't convert credit to cash and that I would have to pay for the shipping for an item that was nothing like advertised. This meant they were not going to honor their own protocol of providing at least 1 opportunity for free shipping/return per order.If only they hadn't issued the credit in the first place...especially since I asked for my funds to be returned to the card I used to purchase my items. The customer service associates I spoke to were very, very nice but ultimately condescending and somewhat patronizing. 'Nice' is not the equivalent of actually listening to a customer and hearing what is being said. It also doesn't mean the customer is always correct but to find a resolution where everyone feels it is a balanced outcome for the benefit of the vendor and customer.Update|May 1,2025: I have attempted 5 times to return the item since March since the initial review with a variety of factors at play: The pants have been declared 'too heavy'; UPS pickup has been arranged via Temu and have not picked up the package...all 5 times; The UPS website doesn't recognize the tracking number and the package cannot be taken to a UPS store.",2025-05-03T15:59:55.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

5cd588d5a71a016a36d061ea,alan segal,US,4,1,The Chinese revenge site,"This was my third order attempt at Temu in about 4 or 5 months. The first two orders were 5 or 6 items that were all inexpensive items, that never looked or worked as good as expected from their online pictures and descriptions, but were so low price I got what I paid for. When you order from them you get lots of follow up emails for another order. Finally I opened one of the emails and they were offering me incredible discounts based on responding to the email. So I ordered a few more items (I'm a sucker for a good deal).I put them in my cart, example a portable air pump regular $28 on special $8, can opener regular $18 for $4.50 etc. They have my credit card info and shipping info so I hit the links to buy and ship. Then a pop up said you are $.50 short of $15 minimum for this order. So I ordered some blank stick-um pads for $.61 and pressed the buy link. When they sent the info on the discounts they never said there was a minimum order amount.To Make a long story shorter: A charge showed up on my credit account for just under $5 which made no sense. But it was so little I thought I'll wait till I see what shipped. about a week later I got 2 stick-um pads (even though I only ordered one) and nothing else. I went to site to see invoice and they charged me $1.22 for 2 note pads and $2.99 for freight. Needless to say I sensed ""bait and switch"" with the discounts offered just to get me to order again. I could not find a phone number for customer service so I got on a chat, first with a robot and then a real person. This was a total waste of over an hour. Because they could find no copy of my order for the discounted items that never showed up nor was I charged for them.Their prices are low even without the discounts, but their customer service and infrastructure is horrible.Say what you will about Amazon, who we do a lot of business with and they are the state of the art of online retail. But Temu is a disaster. Caveat emptor, buyer beware. I will never order from them again.",2025-03-25T01:13:38.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out and we are sorry that you are not satisfied with your items.

67d2aa827070b8e12c1062c4,Michael,ES,2,1,Unbelievable level of Copyright Theft,"This is a follow up to a previous review of Temu concerning the unbelievable levels of copyright theft on the site, with particular regards to artwork that is for sale. It is my firm opinion that Temu should be classed as a criminal organisation, and I‚Äôll explain why below‚Ä¶In my case I am an artist. Every single day I have to check on Temu to remove listings (usually posters prints, canvas prints, metal prints) which feature my stolen artwork. In this last 7 days alone, I have had to report between 50-70 new listings EVERY SINGLE DAY featuring my copyright artwork. Now, in Temu‚Äôs defence they do provide an easy to use reporting system to report copyright infringing listings, and they do usually take down those listings within 24 hours. That is good. But now unfortunately the bad!Of all the online retailers they are by far and away the most lenient when it comes to any punishment for the sellers listing these stolen items. It can take hundreds and hundreds of copyright notices before a seller‚Äôs shop is closed. Virtually all other online marketplaces will ban a seller once they're when they‚Äôve had between 3-10 complaints. Not Temu. They will allow a shop to continually and flagrantly keep posting copying infringing material until there have been many hundreds of copyright notices. Of the 450 copyright notices I had to file over the last 7 days, they are all shared between only 8 different shops. Each day those same shops keep posting new listings featuring artwork they have stolen. They don‚Äôt care. They know how to play the game. They all have multiple shops running at the same time. They know it takes hundreds of complaints before their shops gets closed. Once the shop does finally get closed after racking up hundreds of sales they just open another shop and start again, bulk uploading exactly the same listings that they had in the old shops. Wash rinse repeat. It just goes on and on and on.And what's more, virtually everything listed in those shops is copyright infringing. I took a close look at one of the sellers selling my artwork, and took a random sample of 100 listings (not including my artwork). Of those 100 listings I was able to identify over 70 listings were copyright infringing. Where possible I advised the artists concerned.Hundreds of small independent artists are having their artwork stolen on a catastrophic level by sellers on Temu. Temu is well aware of this but hide behind doing the very bare minimum in law. They could solve this problem overnight by applying much stricter rules to those sellers who breach copyright, like other online retailers do. Why don‚Äôt they? Well of course they also profit from the sales of this copyright material, so it‚Äôs not in their interest. So I ask that anyone considering purchasing any art related products (posters, canvas, metal prints etc) or objects with artworks printed on them (mouse mats, beach towels, water bottles etc) from Temu to think again. You‚Äôre more than likely financing a criminal business by purchasing artwork which has been stolen from a genuine artist. And Temu, in your response to this review, maybe rather than the same old cut and paste nonsense that you ‚Äútake copyright theft seriously blah blah blah‚Äù which is, as I have shown, a blatant lie, try coming up with an actual solution to the problem, like actually being a a lot more strict on the criminals who shops you seem so reluctant to close. Copyright theft is a crime. These sellers are committing a crime. You could easily solve this, you just don't want to. That means you are complicit in criminal activity. That is why, in my opinion, you should be classed as a criminal organisation.Shame on you Temu.",2025-03-24T13:44:49.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for your feedback.

Some people mistake it for an Apple watch! Pretty crazy, right? It has the best customer service I've ever talked to! Their delivery is also amazing too. But everything isn't sunshine and rainbows. One of the most things I don't like about it is it lacks a variety of products to choose from. You could see a pair of 6 times by different sellers and nothing else.

So far my 6 year old grandson has had an electric shock and I have now had 2. I've contacted Temu and now they can't find the order details or any order numbers etc. I gave Jomar ( the customer service rep) my address etc and I've just had a reply that they are not going to do a thing about it. Can't find my details strangely enough. The charger isn't kite marked and is in my opinion extremely dangerous. I emailed Yusman 3 weeks ago and not heard anything back at all. Temu now have warehouses in the UK to store all their sub standard, dangerous items in. I've been in contact with trading standards and Monday I am sending the unit to them for inspection and to finally put an end to dangerous items being sold in our country.

I recently had a terrible experience that I feel compelled to warn others about.I purchased a wig from Teawig but mistakenly ordered the wrong one after browsing several similar wigs on their website. As per their return policy, I promptly returned the wig in its original packaging without even trying it on and requested a refund. However, to my shock, Teawig refused the refund, falsely claiming that I had not returned the same wig!I‚Äôm baffled by this accusation‚ÄîI certainly didn‚Äôt have another brand-new wig lying around to swap it with. Despite explaining the situation, they still refused to honor the refund. Essentially, they have kept both my money and the wig they insist isn‚Äôt theirs.To make matters worse, their communication was condescending and unprofessional. I was addressed as ‚Äúdear‚Äù and ‚Äúlove,‚Äù which I found highly offensive and inappropriate, especially in a dispute regarding a legitimate return.This experience has shown me that Teawig operates with zero regard for honesty or professionalism.

6109dbcd3c9cae0012a664e4,COPLEN/CYNTHIA CHRISTINA,US,7,5,My review after reading negative reviews,"I decided to do this review because I have been extremely satisfied, not only with the products that I‚Äôve purchased, which were many many products of different varieties, such as household, good gadgets furniture, clothing, clothing for family, and friends, such as the children items that I would think would make their lives a little bit easier have a friend who‚Äôs expecting her first child this has been an extremely enjoyable experience. If I have any issues, it is resolved within minutes as long as I have proof such as delivery issues or having items that don‚Äôt belong to me belong to someone else and immediately send a replacement item and told to keep the item that I had which is funny because of the time I was wanting such an item and it just landed on my doorstep. It belonged to someone else in a whole Nother state so apparently there was a mixup in packaging and delivery. If I have an item that‚Äôs broken they refund it. I always choose to have the refund in a form of credit because it goes towards other purchases that I make, which is great for me because it helps me with ordering a more expensive item that I otherwise would have to pay more an example that is when I ordered my automatic self cleaning cat box for multiple cats. It arrived in a timely manner, easy to work, and if I had not had all my credits and coupons added to it. It would‚Äôve cost me nearly 800 bucks easy but because of these coupons and credit that I have accumulated, I was able to purchase it for $174 and some change and I‚Äôve had it now for 11 days. It works like it says I have it programmed to my phone so it alerts me when my pets use it. It alerts me when it‚Äôs being cleaned. It alerts me when it‚Äôs being sterilized it will alert me when it needs to be changed. It would alert me when it needs to be cleaned and it‚Äôs easy to clean, which is excellent for me as I was reading these reviews from very dissatisfied customers, I don‚Äôt understand why it was such a problem for them. I‚Äôve been refunded multiple times. I‚Äôve had products replaced if it was damaged or lost I can‚Äôt say enough about Team. My experience has been excellent and I‚Äôve been with Team for quite a long time so whomever is reading this if something looks too good to be true research it which is what I do I didn‚Äôt make this large purchase on a whim. I researched it found a product on other sites for way more money. I research reviews on such products and was satisfied with the reviews and that is how I make my purchases just research what you want so that you know when it‚Äôs a good deal when it‚Äôs not a good deal. i‚Äôm sorry that the reviews I‚Äôve read that have very poor ratings that they experience was so bad. Also be aware that Temu doesn‚Äôt make all the products to me. They are just a base for other companies so the problem that they‚Äôre experienced such as not getting their refund. It‚Äôs really not coming from temu. It‚Äôs coming from the company that the product originally came from to me. I look at Temu as a huge warehouse of their own products with their own labels, but it‚Äôs also a station to order products from other companies some that are overseas. That‚Äôs where I feel the problem lies. I will continue to be a Temu customer for many years to come, and if I do have any issues that I read on here, I would deal with it appropriately, but as long as I have no issues like that, I will continue to buy there thank you Tio.",2025-03-22T17:09:26.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for your recognition.

If you refund an item they give you a choice, either a credit or back the way they got the money. For me it's thru PayPal. So you get you money back. But most of the time when you click to get the refund back, they will still put it to a credit. So now you have to spend more money to use that credit. Also, they send you offers. Example: they send an offer for 99.9% off. They tell you pick 3 items for a penny each. Then you see go to checkout. At checkout they tell you have have to spend $20 to $30 more to get the 3 items.

The value for money is outstanding‚ÄîI've found a wide range of products at prices that are hard to beat. Whether it‚Äôs clothing, home goods, or tech gadgets, Temu consistently offers great deals that make shopping enjoyable.One of the most noticeable improvements has been in their delivery times. It seems like they‚Äôve opened warehouses in England, as my orders have been arriving much quicker than before. This is a significant plus for anyone who values prompt shipping and doesn‚Äôt want to wait weeks for their items to arrive.However, I do have a small caveat regarding their promotional offers. While they may seem enticing at first, I‚Äôve found that some of these deals can end up costing more in the long run. It‚Äôs best to approach these offers with caution. My advice? Just ignore the flashy promotions and go ahead and buy what you want directly. The prices are already low enough that you won‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre missing out.Overall, Temu is a fantastic option for budget-conscious shoppers. With great value and improved delivery times, it‚Äôs worth checking out.

5dcaba24244183a860899008,Doris Mullins,US,2,2,TEMU's deceptive practices regarding‚Ä¶,"TEMU's deceptive practices regarding their rewards and coupon system are quite frustrating. They often advertise enticing offers, such as $300 in coupons, which initially seem like a great deal. However, the fine print reveals that these rewards are contingent upon spending a significant amount of money, which is not clearly communicated upfront. Many customers, including myself, have found that after making a purchase, the promised rewards and coupons either never arrive or come with stipulations that make them nearly impossible to redeem. This lack of transparency can lead to disappointment and a feeling of being misled. Overall, while TEMU's promotions may catch your eye, be cautious and read the details carefully, as the actual benefits may not live up to the initial promise.",2025-03-21T00:25:41.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for participating in our promotional activities and we are sorry that you are experiencing difficulties with your rewards.

5b4649a84de5666d345e1030,Michael Palmer,GB,53,1,Let down by Temu over very first order,"I and my wife are in our 80s and are having trouble with our toenails, so i went to the Temu site to see if they had anything and they did, so I ordered it, yes it would take a few days to get to me but we felt that this was ok.Today I got an email from them to say the order was out for delivery with there delivery company Evri. The package was delivered at 12 15, I went to the door, no package, all I got was a photo of a door but no package, infact I don't even think it was my door, plus the fact we have a large mail box on the wall that this package would have fitted in, it was no bigger than an oversized mobile phone. On contacting Temu, they did not really want to know, putting me onto some robot. This is the first time I have used Temu, but Evri have delivered loads of times, usually ringing the doorbell which causes the dog to bark and head for the door, but not this time, no door bell and no barking. I feel totally let down by these two companies, I needed the contence of that package to deal with my wife's foot problems and my own, now I will have to go elsewhere to get this sorted which could take days or weeks and to be honest I do not know who to turn too at this moment in time, the wife has dementia and her big toe is in a lot of pain.",2025-03-18T16:49:16.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for shopping with us and we are sorry you are experiencing difficulties with your recent orders.

6156bb5e3a5d9a001250a8d7,Burhan,TR,2,1,This site is a **partial scam**,"This site is a **partial scam**‚Äîmeaning you will receive the product you ordered, but the **fraud lies in its quality, size, and effectiveness**. However, the **real scam** comes from the platform's management. We conducted an experiment two days ago, and here are the details: A pop-up appeared, showing an egg and a message claiming I was eligible for **six completely free gifts**. The system then ran a **fake progress animation**, stating: - ""You have gained energy!"" - ""You have gained additional energy!"" To claim the gifts, you needed to **reach 100 energy points**. Naturally, you would only reach **80 points**, at which point the system prompted you to **invite friends** to continue. After sharing the link with **three friends**, your energy increased to **98 points**‚Äîbut then came the catch. The system now required you to **invite a new user who had never used the platform before**. Once your friend installed the app, you received **1 energy point**. The next invited friend gave you **0.5 points**. The one after that? **0.02 points**. We invited **eight people**, yet the system **only counted four**. There was **no clear rule** for how invitations were accepted. Finally, the last person who signed up was told that in order to help me, **they had to go through the same process I did**‚Äîcreating an **endless loop of pending requests**, forcing users to unknowingly **advertise the platform for free** while gaining nothing in return. ‚ö† **Do not fall for the big bonus coupons!** ‚ö† They claim you will receive a discount **after making a purchase within 30 minutes**. However, once you complete the payment, you only get **a portion** of the coupon. When you check the fine print, you realize the **entire promotion is a trap**. üö® **This website is a scam.** üö® There is no need to discuss product quality‚Äîit is **extremely cheap and low-grade**. -----------------------------------------Response: I received a weak response from the site. During the past two days, I've tried the farm. Oh my goodness, this is another type of scam. Simply don't be fooled by the discounts offered; you'll spend many times more to get them.",2025-03-19T13:26:29.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out and we are sorry that you are experiencing difficulties with our referral rewards program.

67d81dd27062e87079d5ea8d,Robert Fox,US,1,1,Bad Customer Service,"On March 2 2025 I purchase a Vevor 15 gallon oil drain pan with the electric motor. I received my item several days later. The package was not damaged. I changed the oil in my vehicle and went to pump out the old oil. The pump started to pump the oil out and just as the waste oil made it to the end of the hose the electric motor shut off. The motor is dead now and I am stuck with waste oil in the pan. So I contacted Temu and at first they offered me to return the item for a refund. I explained that I did not have the original packaging anymore and would need them to send me some sort of package.

I searched my transactions on my credit card, emails, & photos, Finally, Holy Spirit led me to install the Temu app I had deleted b/c I have been so put out w/ them & still am. Anywho, I found in my messages that Temu was having trouble contacting me via email b/c I chose to hide it having been the victim of ID theft. And, there are t was plain as day that the sorry seller failed to place my order & Temu had given me a $5 refund to make up for it. I appreciate the gesture, but I want to forget I ever heard of Temu b/c they could have sent me a text or called b/c my phone # has not changed since I placed my order on Feb 20th. And, for what it‚Äôs worth, I want to forget I ever heard of Trustpilot. I am in the process of ordering my pool from Walmart & post reviews on a business‚Äôs website or on FB. It is still true that on several occasions I have ordered from Temu in the past and each time it gets a little more stupid w/ the rigged spinning wheel & ‚Äú discounted gifts‚Äù I care nothing about just to get to the couple of items I want to order. It started out great w/ no minimum purchase amount & free shipping. That dog no longer hunts! On Feb 20, 2025 I got so fed up with the BS I canceled my order. Then, several days later, I placed an order just for the one item I wanted. It was an inflatable rectangular pool for $130.94 on my credit card. I took a picture of my transaction as proof of my payment & attached it to my contact CS message i filled out online today wanting to know where my order was. Of course, the robot couldn‚Äôt find my order, & I finally just ended the chat before a ‚Äúlive‚Äù rep could search through my messages regarding this matter & let him know the grade Crooked China Temu had earned was a big fat F that I would be posting online right after I spammed & unsubscribed & stopped all communication with Satan‚Äôs henchmen at Temu!

They offer 3-5 free products for you to win with free shipping. When you're selecting products, they remove the expensive ones from the screen, leaving the cheap ones. But that's not the problem! After selecting products and filling in your shipping address, you'll see that you need 1,000 points to redeem the products. The app starts giving you free points, and your points total reaches 995. A window appears for you to invite friends to get the remaining points. After adding your first friend, you get two points to entice you to invite more. The second gets one point, the third 0.02, the fourth 0.01, and so on. I've invited 10 friends and still need 0.21 points, or 21 more to add to win the gifts.

To say I was disappointed would be an understatement the box was in absolutely terrible shape. It was crushed, torn, and looked like it had been through a rough journey before reaching me.I can't help but feel frustrated and upset about this situation. When you order something online, you expect it to arrive in good condition, especially when it comes to something as delicate as a phone case. The state of the packaging raises concerns about how the product itself might have been handled. I had high hopes for this purchase, and now I'm left feeling let down.

67d2e63c7070b8aa5410cc17,Sir Albert Archibald III,GB,1,1,DONT order from temu LOW quality,"I recently had a really bad experience ordering from Temu, and I have to say it was one of the worst shopping experiences I've ever had. The quality of the items I got was shockingly poor. I ordered a mix of clothes and home goods, and everything felt like it was made from the cheapest materials. The clothes didn‚Äôt fit well at all and fell apart after just one wash, which is totally unacceptable. The electronics I bought didn‚Äôt even work when I took them out of the box, leaving me feeling frustrated and cheated. To make things worse, the customer service was absolutely useless. I reached out for help with my order, but all I got were generic responses that didn‚Äôt address my specific issues. It felt like I was talking to a wall, and I was left feeling completely ignored. The delivery process was another nightmare. My order was delayed multiple times, and when it finally arrived, several items were missing. The tracking information was misleading, and I had no idea where my package was for days. It was incredibly frustrating to deal with such poor communication. When I finally decided to return some of the items, the refund process was a complete hassle. They claimed they hadn‚Äôt received my returned items, even though I had proof of delivery. It felt like they were trying to cheat me out of my money, and I felt powerless. Overall, my experience with Temu was a disaster. I strongly advise anyone thinking about shopping with them to reconsider. Save your money and shop somewhere else because this company clearly doesn‚Äôt care about its customers. I will never order from Temu again, and I hope others take this warning seriously.",2025-03-13T16:05:54.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us. We are sorry for any inconvenience caused.

5cc6cccbe7d72bc50a5296f8,Alice Kakooza,GB,4,1,Treat your customers with dignity a battle of informing‚Ä¶,This has been a battle of informing Temu that I never ever received my parcel which the courier EVRI claims to have delivered my 31items which I diligently ordered with an aim to take to my friends and relatives abroad. I even wrote to Temu to notify them that I would be travelling so they should deliver on my address. They are now convinced the courier delivered the parcel to my door and I have repeatedly sent them a snapshot of my door. That tells a story the courier delivered on a wrong address. And they simply cannot believe me. I now have to loose my money which I used to order over a silly mistake from the EVRI courier. How do you think I feel right now. It's also taken time to be writing to Temu and yesterday I received a tx saying Charlotte would handle my case. Today I received a tx saying my case is closed. Really it's as simple as that losing my money with EVRI who never did their job properly. Why would I be battling with Temu if I received my order. By the way this would be my 3rd time ordering from your Website. Unfortunately the last 31items never received üòï If Temu company is based in the United States.

66aa3af5e12f0d5d72b70231,Georgina,GB,3,1,"Nice products, Bad Company, Bad Customer Service, Shambolic Delivery Service","Temu is not genuine about caring about, or empowering customers to live their best lives like they claim, they regularly fail to deliver orders on time, if you contact Temu they stall you with AI, then robotic sounding humans who aim to sound AI and stick to scripted dialogue that doesn't address your issue. Temu adjusts delivery dates to make it appear they're on track, but their deliveries are slow, and take so long it begins to feel their mode of transport is donkey, or horse and cart! Temu informed me only after my purchase that my order will take up to eight weeks! I don't ever purchase online items that take 56 days to arrive, but letting me know after I ordered didn't give me the option to not proceed or any choice, and is deception. Temu does this because they then can then put the responsibility and inconvenience on the customer to return the order which isn't smooth and they know it. I want my money back, Temu refuse to cancel my order or refund it! They are a money grabbing company that do their best to sound professional but do not operate fully within the law. I should be able to cancel the order that I have not as yet received easily and get my original payment returned as I am not satisfied with Temu's outrageously slow delivery, although I'm their 'valued customer' Ive instead had to dispute Temu with the bank to get my money returned, and I strongly encourage anyone else who is unhappy with Temu's shoddy service to do the same. Temu's real aim is to grab your money no matter what, then lie about your being a 'Dear Valued Customer'. I want a refund for non delivery of my order Temu! I didn't agree to wait 56 days for it! You misled and misinformed me about the ETA. You won't be keeping my money I haven't gifted it to you!Temu's reply below is exactly the kind of condescending nonsense that I've experienced, I've stated I contacted them so why don't they use their systems to know the purchase number ir do they get too many complaints about slow delivery to know, as fir logistics, they don't seem shocked my order will take two months! How dare they keep my money, and for NO DELIVERY, anyway, the bank will reinstate, AGAIN, for anyone experiencing hassle and polite b/s from Temu Customer Services go through your bank to get your refund, Temu is trying to operate within a grey area of the law! TEMU ARE SCAM MERCHANTS POSING AS LEGITIMATE but are a THIRD rate unprofessional service (with a smile of course)Again, Temu emailed me a ridiculous generic message like the numerous ones they use to reply to all these complaints, here's my reply :-What is this message about, precisely what makes Temu incapable of understanding what other consumer companies are able to easily understand? Advising me to keep track of what my bank is doing is not your responsibility Temu, getting my package to me within yoir guaranteed delivery tineframe of within 14 days is your responsibility however you want to put the responsibility everywhere else, on the customer, on the provider, on the weather but not on your shoddy handling of people's orders, you've not persued that at all, but instead give empty and unasked for advice as if to belive it counts as concern for the customer, good customer care, or as doing something. You didn't initiate or want to refund me for breaking your own terms, or for non delivery within a reasonable timeframe, I've had to initiate legal means to compel Temu to do so, your scam needs to be fully investigated and exposed, Temu makes a profit from alot of customer money through items not being delivered to correct destinations, faulty or that never show up and customers not having the time, energy or evn means to go through the hassle of returns.

If I wasn't satisfied with the article it was generally because I didn't pay attention to the measurements. If you go online to Amazon and others you will find exactly the same articles made by the same Chinese companies only 75% more than you can get it for Temu. Two things I really like about Temu. First is their clothes. You choose carefully and you can get some really nice clothes. Some can be cheap but others are well made with good quality cloth. The other thing I really like is that the colours and patterns are so much better than US stuff. That all seems like greys, blacks and other dark and ugly colours/patterns. Temu has beautiful rich colours and really pretty patterns. The second thing I like is that the items like kitchen stuff is really innovative.

630207c46a200b00120ff25d,Dimuth De Zoysa,LK,26,1,"All Hype, No Honesty","I was excited to try Temu, but the experience turned sour quickly. First off, they slap you with a minimum order requirement of LKR 2,218.00 just to check out ‚Äî and this is for first-time users. Most shopping apps don‚Äôt pull these kinds of stunts. It feels more like being pressured into overspending than actually getting a deal.Then there are the ‚Äúfree gifts‚Äù they shout about in ads. I selected the gifts, followed the steps, but at checkout the prices weren‚Äôt zero ‚Äî they showed actual dollar amounts. No explanation, no clarity ‚Äî just misleading marketing.And the spin wheel? I landed on 100% off ‚Äî sounds great, right? Except you can‚Äôt claim it unless you invite people to ‚Äúpack it‚Äù first. It‚Äôs a referral scam disguised as a reward. Pure manipulation.Temu bombards you with flashy offers and fake incentives, but behind the scenes it‚Äôs all hoops, gimmicks, and disappointment. It‚Äôs more frustrating than fun.Until they stop with the tricks and treat customers with transparency, I won‚Äôt be recommending Temu to anyone. Plenty of better, more honest shopping apps out there.",2025-06-02T11:41:07.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for your valuable feedback. To support our commitment to sustainability, we encourage customers to meet a minimum order value so that we can more efficiently utilize the available packing space from bags, to our shipping boxes, and containers. By fully allocating the available packing spaces, we reduce the number of boxes used and number of trips made for our deliveries, which helps to reduce carbon emissions to the environment. However, we understand your concern about the policy and will share your feedback to our team for further review. Thank you for helping us understand and serve our customers better.

639a812c7c9fac0012c6d1d9,Douglas Keene,AU,2,1,Untrustworthy trader,Granted by Temu a credit and to use immediately or lose it. Placed an order for an amount just short of credit . Then found they had charged full price for items ordered.Contacted human customer complaints by chat-detailed complete details-they replied they will help-I said thanks-They thanked me and said glad to have helped and chat closed!!In meantime had ordered shoes at AU$17 when confirm order came thru had been charged over AU$25.

I was given a refund and told to keep the item anyway.In all honesty I have never asked for a refund back to my credit card because I‚Äôm quite happy to have the amount refunded to Temu as I know there will be a few more bits and pieces I need in the future.If the things I wanted to return were over $10 or more, I was able to take them to the Post office and return for free with no problem.With just about every product I order, I first check the price locally and for the most Timu is much much cheaper.I do get sick of their every day emails promising me all sorts of credits and I just delete them.I order and buy what I want if that sits in my basket for any length of time Temu often offers me one of the articles for free which I happily accept.So far, I have been very happy with my experience with this company and I‚Äôve had no problems whatsoever.",2025-03-10T00:45:04.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for shopping with us and sharing your 5-star experience!
