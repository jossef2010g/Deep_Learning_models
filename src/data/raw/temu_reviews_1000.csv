686ca1de2f24781b333d1f09,Armeen Iftikhar,PK,1,1,Long withdrawal delay...,"I joined Temu’s affiliate program with high hopes and worked hard to earn commission. But when I requested a withdrawal, it went into “processing” and has been stuck for over 10 business days now.I submitted all the correct information, and even after correcting a minor name detail they pointed out, nothing has moved forward. I’ve messaged through tickets and live chat multiple times — I only get copy-paste replies or no help at all.This is my money I earned honestly, and now I feel helpless. If something is wrong, I should be informed. If everything is fine, why such a delay?I’m writing this here because I feel completely ignored. I hope Temu sees this and takes the issue seriously. Many small creators like me depend on these payments — this isn’t just a number, it’s our real income.",2025-07-08T06:43:20.000Z,,,

Absolutely misleading when it comes to 75% of their ""money off"" offers.Absolutely useless when you eventually trust them on a large (important) purchase. Any attempt to communicate is met by their A.I. - actually it should be genuine stupidity. Working to a deadline does not allow for me to arrange a return to prove they sent the wrong item in the first place!!! A photograph proves that beyond all reasonable doubt, they flatly refuse to send the item I have already PAID FOR, and uplift the one which should NEVER have been sent.

And leaving negative reviews on absolutely garbage products gets that product removed but still advertising it in other ads showing they don't care as long as they get your money... and as the constant popup ""gimmick sales offers"" they expire in ""limited minutes "" to force a purchase rapidly so you can't find the same product cheaper on a different listing or you miss the ""free"" or ""heavily discounted "" items which are garbage so don't fall for their crap. They breach Australian Consumer Laws with advertising standards by listing the same product after deleting the other one with negative reviews so to hide their garbage they are trying to sell. This didn't just happen on 1 item, it was several all of a sudden removed from sale but still listed on other listing's as available. With their farm garbage, I could see someone taking 5years or longer unless you spend all day everyday on it to get the ""bonus items"" worth FA so that's a gimmick too.

The cost was substantially more than the original orders and one of the items was no longer available.I have written numerous times to their Help team who are either unable to understand or, more likely, cannot be bothered to look into it.

After completing the procedure and creating a profile, I never received the promised product or any credible explanation from the support.I later placed a regular order, but upon delivery one of the items was missing. I provided video evidence to prove that the contents of the package were incomplete, but the only response I received was that ""the item has been shipped"", without further checks or solutions.I find the customer service inadequate and the management of issues inefficient. I have reported the case to the European Commission - Directorate General for Justice and Consumers. In the absence of concrete answers, I will consider filing a petition to the European Parliament on the advertising and commercial practices of the company.Unfortunately, based on my personal experience, I cannot recommend Temu.Honest advice based on my experience:""If you know the danger, you avoid it.""I have contacted the Temu legal office by email and I am waiting for their response with the sending of the Xiaomi 14 as a gift and the sending of what I ordered that I have not received.i found email of legale office temy in the section ""Company data - Legal information"" on them web site.i please, beg and implore them to answer me.",2025-07-05T16:40:30.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

Endless correspondence were demanded that I explained my problems and show evidence to clarify the issue. It was as if we were speaking a different language which they are incapable of explicit meaning. The staff piles you with endless prewritten messages singing their willngness to help if you would tell them your problem.For a 75 year old senior the emotional toll was just too much.DONT BE TEMPTED TO JOIN THE SHOP FOR FREE AS YOU WILL NOT BE REIMBURSED FULLY .IT DOES NOT WORK SMOOTHLY.MY paltry allowance of 60 ringgit today failed as Temu forced me to pay for 2 items in order to check out.Few days ago Temu forfeited my 180 ringgit because I did not want to pay for items which I was entitled for reimbursement . The reimbursement system suffers daily glitch upon check out, customer service behaves like they dont know what you are talking about and the endless nighmare goes on.Below is a rhetorical parrot like refrain in response to my complaint. I counted that they sent me 14 similar cut and paste messages. Temu staff are even unable to respond personally and for any complaints you give they respond with insincere diatribe. I feel sorry for Temu , its staff but sorrier for us , should they become the sole economic power house alone.",2025-07-06T08:15:06.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

5d431b8839d16b9b8897da62,Happy Customer,US,14,4,TEMU is a double-edged sword. Buyer beware!,"TEMU is a double-edged sword. They have provided me with online access to many products at great prices. I am moving to a new home. I have purchased most of what I need from TEMU. Rugs, furniture, light fixtures, wallpaper, shelves, home decor, bedding and kitchen items. I also buy printer ink, cleaning supplies, jewelry, exercise equipment, clothing, office supplies etc...and gifts for friends and family. TEMU never denies my refund requests, they have a 90-day return policy, pay for return shipping, and give me a $5 credit if a package takes longer than stated. They give me an immediate credit as soon as I request a refund. Many times they give me the refund credit and tell me to keep the product. I have never had to file a transaction dispute with TEMU. They are always polite and responsive. Their product instructions are hilarious. I save at least 50% on so many products.BUT BUYER BE BEWARE. Most importantly, DO NOT EVER download their app to your phone. I haven't and I have never had a security problem. I have been purchasing from TEMU for years and I just don't have problems. If you download their app, they may attempt to steal your financial data and many times they are successful. I don't know how it is done but my son studied them in his Cybersecurity class. They stole money from my uncle. A lot! When shopping, be smart, check product reviews, product details, product dimensions, look at all pictures of the product, read between the lines, and double-check prices. Many times, products are much smaller than they appear. Other times, you may think you are buying a product but you are buying a picture of the product. Really, a picture. If a vendor does sneaky stuff, return the product for a refund and don't buy from that vendor again. If you report the vendor to TEMU they will address the issue with the vendor. I know it sounds like I am justifying using TEMU. I am. To clarify...I always have a positive experience buying from Temu. I've included for you above why I feel this way. I haven't had such a positive experience when buying from other sites. I have never had any security issues with Temu. I will continue to buy from Temu. I will take steps to stay secure when buying from any online vendor.",2025-07-05T17:02:52.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us. We are sorry for any inconvenience caused.

As it happens the parcel was stolen.When i contacted Temu using a stupid text service on the app, they just fobbed me off stating the parcel has been delivered. They are responsible for the couriers that they use and for giving them clear instructions not to leave parcels in unsafe places.I am £54.30 out of pocket and do not have my goods.My advice to anybody is to not purchase anything from Temu.

I was promised a number of gifts including the tablet but found I could only claim them daily & guess what- the tablet was the last item. One of the prizes mysteriously changed from what I had chosen a second was unavailable & the tablet now showing as ""Invalid repick"" & no tablet on offer to repick though they are if you want to now pay for one!! Evidence in screenshot as I have gone along Temu. Small print I see now says some gifts may not be available! Well lesson learned- nothing in life is free & if its too good an offer its likely too good to be true.

6866ec7e18a3fc3266f9d005,Jamal Eddine Lz,MA,1,1,"Hidden Scam – Coupons Applied, But Prices Were Inflated!","This is not just disappointing — it's deceptive.I placed an 11-item order on Temu, and a friend of mine, at the same time and from the same location (Morocco), ordered exactly the same products. He ended up paying less than I did, even though I had two active coupons on my account:40 MAD62 MADThey were applied to my order, but here’s the trick:Temu increased the base prices of several items in my cart, which completely cancelled out the value of the coupons. My final price was barely lower, and in some cases more expensive, than my friend’s — and he had no coupons at all!Examples:Mini vacuum: I paid 164 MAD, he paid 138 MADFood chopper: I paid 100 MAD, he paid 79 MADMetal shelf: I paid 75 MAD, he paid 63 MADThis proves that Temu manipulates pricing based on the account. Coupons are just for show — they make it look like you’re saving, when in reality you’re paying more than someone else who sees different prices.⚠️ This is not a discount — it's a psychological trick.I reached out to support and got no explanation.

Their customer care service, 1. is robotic and 2, if you do get to speak to a customer service agent they generally haven't got a clue how to resolve your issue and just escalate to management , when you get to management they're equally as ignorant to your problem as the service agents.They're only responses generally to offer discount codes that must be used within certain periods of time with a minimum spend which means you end up spending more money and getting no resolution. As for the company they use to deliver their packages, - m r w must be one of the worst I have ever come across. It is always delayed and literally anyone's guess as to when your package may arrive, and once again, TeMU try to pawn you off for the further 7 to 9 days before any action may be takenPsAs I write, I'm actually chatting with their customer service and getting the usual robotic replies from their agent.They don't even take any note of what the customer is actually saying!!Just apologies after apologies constantly and offering maybe coupon that entails more spend or, believe it or not, on 3 pop packages, a refund of €2.97 😁😁😜They are an utter joke Your reply to be honest is insignificant if past customer service is anything to go by.So I won't be reaching out to that branch as it's a complete waste of my time and effort.What I am following up on with my solicitor is , your contractual obligations to myself as a purchasing customer.I shall now await a response from my legal representation",2025-07-04T09:35:57.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

You could find better quality goods in the £1 shop. Customer service is appalling. You wait weeks to receive the items only to find them made of terrible materials or be totally different to the description. Then you have to package them back up and send back to be inspected before a refund is issued. If they aren't in the correct pack with the barcode attached (most don't even have this when they arrive with you) then the refund isn't issued. This company is a scam. Don't waste your money or time. The offers may look appealing but trust me they aren't real. They say something is worth £30 when in fact it's barely worth £5 then dazzle you with massive discounts.

536d4b03000064000172ac7d,George,US,2,1,Don't trust their advertising or customer service.,"I have been a TEMU customer for a handful of years. They have been good about shipping products, replacing the occasional missing item without too much difficulty... However, I have often been dissatisfied with product quality, and a constant bait and switch paradigm. The ads I receive from them are rarely legitimate: the links don't bring you to the advertised product, or, when they do for clothing, the advertised price is only good for one size, or one clearly unpopular color, or, the price is only good if you buy many more dollars of merchandise. I spent 50 minutes with online customer service today. They said the offer I received was only good for 24 hours, and the date of the offer was a day last week, even though I received the offer at 2:11 Eastern time today. My customer service rep was quite polite, but steadfastly declined to honor the offer I received... or give me to a supervisor, or contact information for one... or a name and mailing address for the CEO... I did later today receive a polite 'Sorry you were unhappy, but we are following our procedures' type of email reply. In fairness to them, I have been quite pleased with about 40% of the products I have ordered from them... the other 60% have mostly been 'as shown' but far less serviceable than expected. I am a camping enthusiast: I will say I have always been happy with their titanium products.They replied here to my complaint. I spent another 2-hours-ish answering several emails and on chat with them. Then I sent them the EMAIL offer they sent me... They asserted that I couldn't possibly have received the email I did, that I misquoted the offer, and said that I didn't respond to the (other) offer in time so, SOL. Here are some of their responses:Dear Valued Customer,This is a follow-up email in regards with your concern.Upon further review, based on the photo you provided, the item in this photo does not match to the item reward on the event ""Discount on One Cart Item"".

6865ad3f8a53754bd1859023,Milorad Krusica,ME,1,1,Temu broke their promise and kept my money - 3 years of empty answers,"I ordered from Temu while I was still living in the United States, and I clearly told them that I was **leaving the country soon** — I asked them to make sure the product arrives on time, otherwise I would not be able to receive it.They **guaranteed it would arrive**, and said that if it doesn't, they would issue me a full refund to **any card I can use** — just to convince me to order. It *never arrived*, and they gave me €150 in Temu credits which I cannot use internationally since I now live in Montenegro. I told them repeatedly that the original U.S. card is **permanently closed**, and that I **cannot access any money** refunded there. For almost **3 years** I've been talking to support, explaining the same thing over and over, and they just keep saying ""we refunded it to your card"" even though they know I **can't receive anything that way**. I’ve asked for a PayPal refund where i am still connected to that card which is now closed or some other card or even Temu credit that works outside the U.S. — nothing. This is the worst support experience I’ve ever had. They made a mistake, broke their promise, and refuse to help. I’ve lost €150 because of it.

I fell down the TEMU rabbit hole. At first, received items, MUCH smaller than expected. But I can work around that. Lesson learned. Then, after so many orders, they started showering me with coupons, after qualifying purchases, of course. Here's where they getcha. One receives the incorrect item, or doesn't receive anything at all. Vendor, doesn't respond. And TEMU's response is to offer another coupon, not a great coupon that one just used. Yep. One has to buy even more. Coupons are not credited back to one's account. Items are not replaced. It goes on & on, 'til one, me, finally realizes that they're paying for ads/pictures only, of the items one wants.FYI both Amazon and Walmart, offer the same or similar. One, caveat, slightly more expensive. But, here's the kicker, one actually RECEIVES the item. Shocker. So, for broke me, well worth the higher cost.Now, if one, you, just likes handing over hard earned funds, for nothing in return, feel free to reach out, 😉The old adage ""If it seems too good to be true, it isn't"".

But be cautious when buying anything that requires accurate sizing like clothing. If they do not have your size in stock, they may just send a smaller one. They also claim their sizes match UK sizing, which is completely untrue.I ordered four XL shirts. None of them were actually XL. One was clearly a small, and it felt like they just put an XL sticker on the bag. Based on other reviews, I am not even bothering to return them. I have already thrown them in the bin. The same thing happened when I ordered trousers.Also worth noting, the material is very thin whether it is trousers or shirts, and definitely not suitable for UK weather.

However they did not, I even have a video camera that proves there was no FedEx activity at my door during time of alleged delivery or at all that day. So I called FedEx, FedEx verified with me that the package was not delivered to my address as it was supposed to, but instead delivered to a FedEx location, reason as told to me by FedEx, is the drivers are allowed to do that when it's economy shipping basically they can handle your delivery anyway they want, mark it delivered but not even bring where its supposed to go. So its obvious, the package was not delivered to me. I contacted seller and Temu customer service because both are telling me to contact the other, I explain to them what FedEx has told me. And since FedEx did not deliver to my apartment like they were supposed to, there was no way I was going to go pick it up from them. Temu says to contact the seller, I did with proof from my video camera footage showing no FedEx activity during that time or day, shipper says give them 1-2 days to make a decision. They deny my refund saying to contact Temu, I contacted Temu with the same proof, Temu says, it would take 2-4 days and says they see i already have a refund claim and to contact the seller yet again. I contacted the seller again with my refund claim. Did I mention since they are the shipper they are indeed privy to the same FedEx information or even more detailed info than me. But I guess that makes too much sense for them to be reasonable enough to verify on their own as well. Anyway, I come back showing actual proof from FedEx saying at the very top of the tracking page ""This package is being returned since we're unable to deliver it"", right below it in with a BIG RED mark from FedEx says: RETURNING TO SHIPPER. FedEx clearly stated on tracking page they were unable to deliver it, how is that not proof that it was never delivered to my apartment like it was supposed to, how is the RETURNING TO SENDER, not proof as well. I sent both seller and Temu proof. Seller still denied my refund and said contact Temu, I contacted TEMU AGAIN AND AGAIN with the same proof I gave to seller. TEMU replies back ""We will verify the delivery status with the seller as soon as possible, and the expected verification time is 72 hours. Once there are any updates, we will inform you immediately"" - ARE THEY SERIOUS!!!!!!!! WHAT MORE PROOF CAN BE MORE VIABLE THAN THE ACTUAL PROOF FROM THE FEDEX TRACKING PAGE SAYING IT COULD NOT BE DELIVERED, RETURNING TO SENDER!!!!!! THIS HAS BEEN GOING ONE FOR 2 WEEKS NOW.

Tried to contact them and their excuse was that by the time i reached out the offer was expired.obviously the items arrived after 2 weeks.

551bfd7a0000ff0001b57a55,Robert Duirs,GB,158,1,"No receipts or confirmation of orders,","This appears to be a shocking money-grabbing dishonourable and altogether dishonest company. Stuff fails to arrive, although paid for; the stuff that does arrive is not as described and they fail to respond to emails of complaints. They seem to be associated with scamming sites such as stylishoes, sadly. Very sneakily, they make use of unreliable suppliers who fail to provide any confirmation of orders that have been placed or any invoices. Their associate so-called suppliers namely Stylishoe are involved in disgusting and possibly criminal activities. As a company of apparent con-artists they supplied 5 pairs of shoes all of which are the wrong size (a centimetre too short and with no size labels). One pair of slippers never arrived at all. Also none of the shoes were wide-fitting as advertised (that being precisely why we ordered them) Every single complaint to the suppliers was ignored. When I opened and tried on the jumper that I’d ordered from them, it was impossible to even get my arm into it: so I checked the label to see if a mistake could have occurred, I discovered that what had been sent was a second-hand extremely small jumper with the label cut off. These suppliers and associates for Temu appear to be a company of fraudsters and active con-artists. Perhaps some Chinese and HongKong based companies are trustworthy but that is surely not one of them, sadly. This company in sending the rubbish products of Stylishoe dub themselves as the “retailer’’ : all part of the same con-artistry I presume… Temu must obviously take full responsibility for their agents and suppliers, not hide behind them as appears to be the case. The most dodgy aspect is that no invoices and no confirmation of orders were sent to me - so they get away with it all.",2025-07-07T19:19:19.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for shopping on Temu!

Tried sending them back. But their returns policy is so long and drawn out, that like most people I gave up. I recently bought to silver rings one for each of my granddaughters birthdays. After giving one to one of my granddaughters it snapped in half. I sent it to their head quarters in Dublin along with a photo of the pyjamas, via recorded delivery over a month ago, and as yet I have had no reply. Yes I know they state that we are not to send goods back to them. But if they made their returns policy easier people wouldn’t have to do this. A lot of other companies send return forms with goods you order from them, along with a reference no, of the goods you order from them in case you need to send anything back. Why can’t Temu do this. And more to the point why can’t they have the decency to reply to complaints.

Twice it was supposedly 'escalated' to the ridiculously called 'Customer Resolution Senior Specialist' who looks into the issue and responds by email. The irritating part of this is that the 'specialist' sends a scripted email giving the instruction of what to do in the order process - this would be funny if I hadnt spent 2 hours during each online chat waiting in between my issue and their scripted pointless responses!!!I dont have a resolution as the 'specialists' just close the ticket when they send their scripted irrelevant email.Trying to get a simple answer as a consumer is impossible with Temu - no wonder they are being investigated by the European Consumer Councils!But, a positive amongst the gloom, I did chat with 'Malik' just now who was the one and only customer advisor who offered an intelligent possible answer to my issue!So, I hope you are all lucky enough to get Malik on the Temu chat line!UPDATE - response from temu added below! Sorry I do not have another 2 hours to give today in 'chat line'.In wanting to purchase the utility art knife pen set with cutting nibs the size of pen nibs, they still fall under the 'age verification' law. A box pops up to fill with all personal details.When asking how the details were checked, it took several attempts on the 'chat' over 2 days with waiting for responses making each up to 2 hours long - and with responses varying -We dont have that information;We cant give that information; Temu does;A third party;I asked who was the 'third party'? and was challenged as to who told me it was a third party!Like the majority of people, I care where my info is going, so persisted:II have to state again that Temu's Customer Resolution Senior Specialists are absolutely pointless as they ignore anything you are asking about and just send a standard pre-written email that has no connection!Finally I got through to Malik who did not consistently send me pre-written scripts that had no connection to what I was asking and he suggested it would probably be my payment organisation....the first Temu customer advisor who was able to think outside the pre-written responses!Checking on Amazon, they have the answer to my question already printed in the 'age verification' info.And - FYI - to get a credit card a person must be 18 and over; to have a paypal account a person must be 18 and over; to GET A TEMU ACCOUNT a person must be 18 and over.........",2025-07-01T08:24:49.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

6860447a8a537581217fcc7b,Martin,CR,1,1,Problem(a) Temu Aeropost Costa Rica,"3-7-25 After my relentless scrambling to save the situation, Temu has simply indicated they will reimburse me so I will follow up with a more pointed review shortly27-6-25 (Español a continuación) The chances are that you too will be taken advantage of by sleazy tricks. There is a multitude of systemic problems with Temu and Aeropost, their local delivery service in Costa Rica but on this particular situation, dishonesty is the reason my package was not delivered, no attempt was even made and the local delivery service lied about making an attempt and then promising to try another time. I provided evidence they did not follow protocol and because they couldn't refute it, they used up time pretending they were working on it Aeropost saying they are preparing to bring the package and Temu saying they couldn't locate the package (which is also evidence of intent). So after they let the time expire, they send me a message the case is now closed, they found the package and i can go pick it up (at a location 5hrs away!). It is hard to convey systemic dishonesty but sometimes it is possible. This story goes much deeper as it involves Aeropost who flat out threatened, lied and Temu just pretended and promised to find and deliver the package but that too was misdirection. What they do is just a cascade of cut and paste ""dear customer, we have been trying to locate your package..."" I doubt anything is being done and this is just the standard Kabuki. If this was court, by breaking down each step, I could demonstrate how both Temu and Aeropost refused to assume responsibility for their failure of one maybe several employees and instead punished me to save money and effortLo más probable es que a usted también se aprovechen de usted con trucos turbios. Hay una multitud de problemas sistémicos con Temu y Aeropost, su servicio de entrega local en Costa Rica, pero en este caso particular, la deshonestidad es la razón por la que mi paquete no fue entregado; ni siquiera lo intentaron y el servicio de entrega local mintió sobre intentarlo y luego prometió volver a intentarlo. Presenté pruebas de que no siguieron el protocolo y, como no pudieron refutarlo, perdieron el tiempo fingiendo que estaban trabajando en ello: Aeropost dijo que se preparaban para traer el paquete y Temu dijo que no lo pudieron encontrar (lo cual también es evidencia de intención). Entonces, después de que se cumpliera el tiempo, me enviaron un mensaje diciendo que el caso estaba cerrado, que encontraron el paquete y que podía ir a recogerlo (¡a 5 horas de distancia!). Es difícil transmitir deshonestidad sistémica, pero a veces es posible. Esta historia es mucho más profunda, ya que involucra a Aeropost, quien amenazó y mintió abiertamente, y Temu simplemente fingió y prometió encontrar y entregar el paquete, pero eso también fue una distracción. Lo que hacen es una cascada de copias y pegas: ""Estimado cliente, hemos estado intentando localizar su paquete..."". Dudo que estén haciendo algo, y esto es simplemente el típico Kabuki. Si esto fuera un tribunal, al desglosar cada paso, podría demostrar cómo tanto Temu como Aeropost se negaron a asumir la responsabilidad por el incumplimiento de uno o varios empleados y, en cambio, me castigaron para ahorrar dinero y esfuerzo.",2025-07-03T16:07:13.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

You'll be out of pocket and without the goods you ordered.,"Temu's parcel -tracking number H0483A1291700009 - did not arrive, although they claim it did, based on a photo by Evri taken not outside our door [clearly marked and numbered] , but taken from the street pavement of the door leading to several apartments. I contacted Temu several times, they don't respond. On their website they advise one should contact the courier - that's how far their 'help' goes. This was the second parcel that did not arrive, and where Temu just ignored the problem. Tracking Number:H0483A1265870020, non-delivery on May 15. Again, the photo showed parcels out in the street where there is heavy footfall, and NOT in front of my apartment door.

65956421cabbd00012097aa7,FIONA BELL,GB,4,5,Prompt delivery by royal mail,So far I've made one order and I believe it was delivered by royal mail. It promptly arrived and the guy was able to get into my apartment building. So I was a very satisfied customer. This is because royal mail is given a special code to enter the building since they deliver all the post ie letters to homes. The guy was able to enter the building and he came to my apartment door. Royal mail have a procedure that if they deliver large packages and the person is not at home they will take it back to their depot and try 3 more times. As a courier they are very reliable and trustworthy.I have just placed another order yesterday 27th June. It shows on the tracking system that Evri will be the courier which I'm wary of. They have the reputation of going to the wrong addresses and taking photos to show that they have dropped it off as proof of delivery but in a lot of cases they have gone to the wrong address. With regards to an apartment building it becomes more complicated. They have the option of ringing the apartment number on the intercom at the main entrance door to gain access to the building. But in my one experience of Evri they didn't do that even though I made sure I was at home at the time the tracking system had given. With my latest order from Temu I hope the delivery goes right. I'll wait and see!,2025-06-28T19:33:07.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for shopping with us and sharing your 5-star experience!

They nag you claiming you can get free gifts and tell you to pick them. After you pick them they tell you that you have to purchase additional things to get your free gifts. Again not unreasonable. Here's where it gets shady and underhanded. You place the order thinking you're getting getting the free items as well . Wrong. You get the items that are the ones they claim you had to choose to get the free items that you paid for. It's happened twice to me.

685efc928a537536b27ecfe4,Álvaro Juárez López,ES,1,1,Me siento estafado 😞,"Participé en la promoción WINCREDIT de Temu entre el 25 y el 29 de junio, realizando compras por más de 100 €, cumpliendo con lo indicado en la propia app. A pesar de ello, el sistema no reconoció adecuadamente mis compras y, tras múltiples intentos de contacto —a través de bots, agentes y escalaciones— no obtuve una solución concreta ni personalizada.El principal problema no ha sido la promoción en sí, sino la falta de claridad en las condiciones, la gestión automatizada del servicio de atención al cliente y la ausencia de resolución ante un caso documentado y argumentado en todo momento.Como consumidor, he invertido dinero, tiempo y buena voluntad. Lamento profundamente la experiencia y espero que puedan mejorar sus procesos para futuras campañas.--I participated in Temu’s WINCREDIT promotion from June 25th to 29th, making purchases of over €100 as indicated in the app. Despite following the instructions, the system didn’t properly register my progress, and after multiple contacts —via bots, agents, and escalations— I received no clear or personalized resolution.The main issue wasn’t the promotion itself, but the lack of transparency in its conditions, the overly automated customer service, and the absence of any real solution despite providing evidence and cooperating throughout the process.As a customer, I invested money, time, and good faith.

They were never packed or shipped, yet Temu counted me as having received them. I contacted customer support, expecting them to simply fix the mistake.Instead, they just told me the “claim deadline” was over — which makes no sense, because I never received the gifts to begin with. They offered me only 200 SEK in credit as “compensation”, which doesn’t cover the value of the missing items and feels like a way to brush me off.The whole experience feels dishonest and disappointing.

685e7c8a2f247822a02eadab,Natalie Myra,GB,1,1,Apparently Being Disabled Means You Don’t Deserve Parcels,"⭐ 1 starI’m honestly heartbroken by this experience. I’ve been recovering from a car accident, in pain and unable to get around — and Temu’s delivery partner (Yodel) has caused me nothing but distress and anxiety.I stayed home all week waiting for my parcel. I live in a top-floor flat and clearly stated that the top buzzer must be used — it’s the only way I can know someone’s at the door. Despite being reassured that the driver would follow these instructions, they weren’t.Yodel then claimed they’d attempted delivery three times, but they hadn’t. No buzzer pressed. No chance for me to answer the door. Just an assumption that I wasn’t in — which is false and deeply frustrating.I contacted support, explained my limited mobility, and asked for help. Instead, I was told to travel to collect the parcel from a depot — something I physically cannot do. I was left in tears, feeling ignored, powerless, and honestly ashamed for needing support.It’s not just poor service — it’s a complete lack of care for vulnerable and disabled people. What’s even worse is how easily this could have been avoided by simply listening and following basic delivery instructions.I never expected to feel this dismissed and excluded as a customer. This experience wasn’t just inconvenient — it was emotionally exhausting.I don’t say this lightly: if you’re vulnerable, disabled, or rely on simple accessibility being respected — please think twice before ordering.",2025-06-27T13:12:15.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

Nobody has to wait in a q everytime U go on there normally. Now they just don't want to answer. Pathetic. They send a voucher for £5 off a £50 order lmfao why on earth would I place an order when I'm waiting for a refund on a replacement garden ornament that was smashed. Into the 8th week as they put it on a land delivery. Had a smashed cup they wanted me to send it back 🤣🤣 sorry but that's dangerous, I'll take the hit. Trainers are always too small even when they do manage to send the right size. I have 4 pairs of trainers and a pair of sandals they sent the wrong size for, blatantly, I did get a refund without sending back as I refused a partial refund, £1.78 for shoes I can't wear. I received a dress today I've asked them to pick up but apparently they don't do that. I run my own business and really busy. So I'll end up keeping it. Alot of the tops are small fitting if you like to move in them. They say U get cash back on orders. What you don't realise it's over 5 dAys. They will not give you it in one go. Their discount offers are overpriced so U think U are getting 80%off. That's not true the price U think h are getting on offer is their normal price. Sometimes more expensive than what they have if U look at for it yourself. Everything is a con on here.. What I will not do is send back broken pot with sharp edges. Idiots think this is ok. It's not ill take the hit rather than risk someone's hands. Never think they are doing you a favour y sending vouchers to apologise for the long wait of their ultra slow deliveries.

61513173951d9e00128b6500,N rahal,NL,7,1,Unfortunately,"Unfortunately, my experience with Temu has been very disappointing. While the platform appears attractive with flashy deals and heavy discounts, most of these offers are misleading or downright deceptive. Coupons are advertised heavily, but once you make a purchase in hopes of redeeming them, you find out they come with hidden conditions and are rarely valid for quality products, electronics, or locally shipped items — only for specific, low-demand items.I’ve had several frustrating experiences: • Customer service responses are mostly generic and unhelpful, wasting both time and patience. • Some shipments sent by ground shipping took nearly two months to arrive. • Items have arrived in damaged or open boxes, giving the impression that they were previously used — completely unacceptable if you plan to gift them or expect something new.The final straw was a recent order for a Nintendo Switch 2, priced at €604. I paid an additional €80 in customs fees in the Netherlands. When the product arrived, it turned out that it did not include the Mario Kart game (which was supposed to be part of the bundle and worth around €80 on its own).I contacted support and submitted clear photo evidence. The only response I got was: “You can return the item for a refund.”After waiting nearly two months, paying customs, and being let down by the missing item, this solution was far from acceptable. By the time I returned the product, waited for a refund, and reordered a replacement, I’d be waiting another two months.Temu may look like a budget-friendly platform, but in my experience, it cost me more time, money, and energy than it was ever worth.",2025-06-26T23:26:37.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

Satisfied for the most part, BUT you need to be aware that you get what you pay for. The cost of everything is really cheap, and therefore the products you get are really cheap too. As long as you keep that in mind when you shop, you'll enjoy the great selection. I've had a couple returns with them too - although the actual return process is a little cumbersome (and you can't exchange right now - only return) it was free and I did get my money back. The one issue I have is the $5.00 refund you get for ""late delivery"". You can only claim it on the App and it brings up a list of items to purchase where you can then apply it to. If indeed they want to give me $5.00, just credit it to my account! Overall, I do like shopping on Temu, but very carefully.",2025-06-26T17:51:16.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

Sure, you'll get your delivery, but the quality is complete garbage, the packaging is a bag so your stuff will be thrown and smashed when you get it. Be very careful of the items, always look at the description and never go by the photo. Something that looks like a good size will almost 100 percent of the time be 80 percent smaller. The photos they use are fabricated, so they are hoping to target people like me who are trusting and just assume that what you see is what you get. Definitely not the case.

I used this online shopping website for quite a long time and spent soo much of my money on it, but in return what dk I get? Customer support's robotic replies, no helpful replies or solutions. They keep insisting on returning a 27kr worth item when it is not even my fault. Whenever I inquire about any item at all, all they do is give me a return for a refund option. Then the bot won't even let me talk to any real agent too. And this process keeps on repeating whenever I contact the customer support.

5b900b474de5666d34d8c9cd,Mrs Tina Banemeck,GB,25,3,Temu app and non-existent credits,"While I enjoy the variety of goods and cheap prices offered by Temu, what totally frustrates me is when you download the app you are bombarded with constant Offers and every time you try and get, free credit offered et cetera it does not work.I recently did a promotion to get £170 back into my PayPal account or as credits. I only had to put in a small order which I did and waited for my £170 to emerge, only to get another message saying that I had to play the game over again to get £170. I just done this But no credit or money materialise. I’ve just managed to contact the customer services they said I did not qualify because I didn’t do it in time, or I didn’t put in a proper order, all I was told was to put in an order for around £5 Which I did and no reward materialised. These offers encourage you to put in more and more orders to qualify for the extra credit such as 100% of your order back, I’ve never had anything back yet!I have spent several thousand pounds over the last year on Temu so I am a good customer, but I do not like these ridiculous offers that never materialise no matter how hard you tried to fit in with their rules. I even took photos last time to show that I had completed the challenge. The customer Services has offered me £4 back. I said no and they just said ok thanks and goodbye.If I didn’t like shopping on this site for the goods and cheap prices, I would not shop with them. But what I’d advise people to do is not upload the Temu app because you will not stop getting emails and ridiculous offers of credit, et cetera. If it wasn’t for these ridiculous offers of non-existent gifts et cetera I would’ve given them a higher mark I’ve only given them three stars because I like the products and the prices.",2025-06-23T23:32:23.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for participating in our promotional activities and we are sorry that you are experiencing difficulties with your rewards.

While the one product I ordered was surprisingly good quality, the overall experience just isn’t worth it. I returned an item, received store credit — and then watched it disappear after a certain number of days with no warning.When I signed in to use it, the credit was already gone.There’s no real customer support, and they clearly have no interest in actually making the customer happy. Sure, Temu’s prices are cheaper than Amazon, but it comes at the cost of reliability and accountability.Stick with something reputable. Amazon may be more expensive, but at least they stand behind their service.",2025-06-22T14:30:26.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us. We are sorry for any inconvenience caused.

I ordered a shed (PO-210-14660126710391339) that arrived with a number of parts missing, which was disappointing enough. But the real issue started when I tried to return it.The return label provided was totally inadequate for the size and weight of the item. I was only given a drop-off label, and since I don’t have a car and can’t carry such a large item on my own, I had to hire a man with a van to take it to the EVRI drop-off point. However, the package was refused at THREE different locations because of its size and weight – apparently, none of the stores could handle it. Upon informing temu they could not provide another solution and told me to take photos”be patient” and went on a tangent about how great their customer service is???Now, over a week has passed, and I’ve been bouncing back and forth with customer service. I keep receiving nonsensical responses, such as being asked to take photos or to look at instructions – which is laughable because there are no instructions! I can’t even open the package again because it took me forever to wrap it back up, and there’s no way I’m going through that hassle again.So, essentially, Temu took my money, sent me an incomplete shed with no usable parts, and now they’re making it nearly impossible to return the item and get a refund. This has been a complete nightmare, and I would NOT recommend buying anything from them. Stay far away from Temu!",2025-06-21T11:45:30.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

I only needed one small item and they refused to sell it to me until I ordered more stuff even though I had been buying regularly from them. I requested to have the minimum amount removed and they insisted it is just to help the environment and save on packaging but the truth is they just want you to spend more money. I told them they would lose me as a customer and they just kept apologising for the inconvenience and offering me a £20 off voucher if I spend more than £40 but still wouldn’t take the minimum order amount off of my shopping cart and just kept asking me if I could get any family members to help in buying some more items so that I could fulfil the minimum order amount.

6855634cf0e9f3271979fd16,Petar,MK,1,1,"The Dark Side of Temu: Cheap at First Glance, Costly in Regret”","Temu is actually THE WORST SCAM COMPANY!! All the products sold on Temu are twice as expensive compared to local stores. For example, a polishing machine on Temu costs about €40 with one 12V battery, whereas in a local store in Macedonia, the exact same polishing machine comes with two 18V batteries and you get a bonus cordless pressure washer—for around €37!Secondly, TEMU SELLS TRASH!! Heavy, low-grade Chinese junk that doesn't last even a week of use—extremely low quality! Another example: the air fryer Temu sells for €40, under the name Silver Cest you can find it in Macedonian stores for about €20 to €25!You buy sneakers or sandals that fall apart quickly and injure your feet. Temu says to return the item—how on earth am I supposed to return something that's completely torn up and stained with blood after it cut my foot?I can't even think of the worst possible word to describe Temu!I already explained everything to customer service clearly, but it's POINTLESS—they’re also idiots who either don’t understand or simply don’t care!P.S. I had 2 more parcels on the way, but I DON’T CARE. I submitted a complete request to delete my Temu profile!!SO PEOPLE!! DO NOT BUY FROM TEMU!!

The QR code was scanned and I was told I would receive a proof of drop off by email. I never received an email with the proof of drop off, so I contacted both Homerr and temu. Homerr was quite clear, something went wrong with the scan so the parcel was transported and stuck in their distribution centre. They explained me the procedure; I should contact the webshop who shipped the initial order, temu in this case, and that the webshop should open a claim through the Homerr website (as Homerr operates for temu). This procedure is also explained on their website. So, I contacted temu 6 times and explained the situation 6 times, and they have been absolutely useless! They keep on asking me for a proof of drop off, while the whole point is that I never received a proof because something went wrong with the scan!!! I even forwarded a screenshot of the reply I received from Homerr helpdesk, and still they do not contact Homerr to submit a claim. Instead of taking the case serious temu just closed my ticket! No follow up, no refund or whatsoever! Such a lousy temu helpdesk - they are totally unaware of the procedure to follow, or just lazy, ...

6851096b2f247804bb1fa4ac,Bhoomi Rachchh,AE,1,1,Items Returned but not Refunded,"I am honestly beyond frustrated and completely shocked at this point. Two items under Tracking No: JTE300299583146 were collected from my address on June 9, 2025, and now I receive a message from Temu saying the return can’t be processed because the items never reached you? Are you kidding me?The delivery agent picked up the package right from my doorstep. I’ve attached photos showing the items were collected and delivered to your warehouse. So where did it disappear after that? That’s your responsibility—not mine. I did everything by the book: packed the items, waited for pickup, handed them over. And now? I’m sitting here without the products and without my refund.And this isn’t even the first time. Previously, I returned an item and never got the refund of AED 68. Now I’ve lost AED 245.33 again for items that were picked up with confirmation. Don’t even try to come back with excuses like “maybe the item wasn’t packed properly”—because it was, and packed with 10 other items that were received just fine.All 12 items were picked up together. You received most, but somehow the ones with the higher value mysteriously vanished? That’s suspicious, and frankly unacceptable.So now let me be very clear:Total refund due = AED 68 + AED 245.33 = AED 313.33.I want this amount refunded immediately.To make things worse, there’s no proper customer support. No phone number, no working chat, no email ID—just automated replies from an AI bot that’s absolutely useless when it comes to real issues like this. So now I’m writing to every Temu contact I can find, because I’m tired of being ignored.If I don’t receive a proper resolution and refund ASAP, I will escalate this further—publicly. I will share my experience across every social media platform and consumer forum possible, because this is no way to treat a loyal customer. I’ve been shopping regularly with Temu, and I did not expect this kind of behavior.I've attached full proof—pickup confirmation, package photos, item details. Now I expect a clear and immediate response:Where are my returned items?When will my AED 313.33 refund be processed?",2025-06-17T08:21:46.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

Suddenly, the tracking status changed backwards to “picked up by customs processing company,” without any explanation. There is no clear information on where the package actually is.I have contacted Temu’s customer service several times, but each time I receive the same standard response: “Wait 24 hours.” When I follow up after 24 hours, I get the exact same reply again. It’s obvious that no one is actually reading what I’m writing, and no real effort is being made to resolve the issue.They refuse to refund my money, even though the package hasn’t arrived, and instead they try to “compensate” me with a discount code that comes with usage conditions – as if that solves the problem. It feels dishonest and irresponsible.I am now left without my item, without my money, and without any real help.

Disappointed but not surprised, I reached out to Temu’s customer service team — a department that seems to exist solely to mirror their dismal Trustpilot rating.They sell poor quality bric-a-brac, then have the audacity to refer to you as a “valued customer” while treating you like an inconvenience. On previous occasions, they told me to discard faulty items and issued refunds without returns — which, at the very least, was efficient. Now, a so-called “senior” customer service agent is insisting that they never do that. So what’s the truth here? Are you calling me a liar?They now want me to take the item to a drop-off point so they can discard it?

Echt Blöde Methoden bei Temu! Normalerweise könnte Jemand das als Kritisches / Kriminelles Verhalten von Temu Bezeichten!

Mir wurde Einfach der WLan Adapter aus dem Warenkorb genommen weil es der Letzte Artikel war. So zu sagen Ausverkauft! Extremely Bad Store/Site!Temu not only offers a lot of unusable and poorly made goods, you also get robbed!For example, if there's only one item left in your shopping cart that you haven't paid for yet, Temu will ruthlessly remove it from your cart and sell it to someone else.What if I want to buy milk in the store and there's none left, and then I take a liter from another shopper's basket? You shouldn't do that either!Temu's really stupid methods! One could consider that as critical/criminal behavior on Temu's part! I'm just saying, this is wrong, to take from others what you have searched for and for quite some time!This makes shopping/ordering at Temu no fun!Above all, you've spent quite a bit of time on the computer trying to find the right product!Temu: Absolutely outrageous and totally ruthless!The Wi-Fi adapter was simply removed from my shopping cart because it was the last item.

Katikati is not there so I can’t return anything. Senseless driving fown to Tauranga to return a couple of things - cost me return value in petrol. I’ve done the chat thing with them this morning but was told NZ Post is not currently available! I’ve explained to them who they are…. They have absolutely no clue.

However, this is my third time using them, and each time they've delivered exactly what they advertised and promised—at great value. So far, it's been a great experience, and I haven't had any issues.That said, I do find their constant promotions and offers quite confusing and overwhelming. Everyone loves a good deal, but the way the discounts and promos are presented can make it difficult to understand what you're actually getting. For example, there's this £170 cashback into your PayPal account, and I honestly don't know if that's real or not, so I’m unsure about it.Because of all the flashy deals, endless images, and seemingly unrealistic discounts, they can come across as a bit scammy. Some of the offers really do seem too good to be true—and maybe they are. But I just want to say that, for me, the experience so far has been really, really good.

All 8 completely disappeared from my account. When the orders arrived, no gifts. Contacted customer service and was told I had the promotion wrong and I checked out from the wrong page. With a £15 minimum spend for shipping, I paid under that on both occasions. So how had I done it wrong and not on the promotion page? Initiated a return on one of the orders, as I only really bought made the order because of a deal on the promotion. They only want the items back! For their mistake! Two packs of paper. The promotions seem like tricks. Customer service is horrendous and they put the blame on the customer for their mistakes, lies and tricks. Probably will never use Temu again. Horrendous! Update 18th June 2025: I've kept pushing for some sort of resolution, at the very least a good will gesture from Temu, for days.

I bought some sets of shelves that were rated at 5400 lbs and 3000 lbs. The images were of some heavy shelves. I received them and they are so flimsy, they bend and twist just putting them together. They are extremely unsafe. They tried offering me $17 for a refund instead of the $266. I filed a return and they canceled it while I was sleeping and said I did it, at 2:41 am !!!!! Now they say I have to pay for the returns because I canceled the original one. They also will also give only one return label for 2 large boxes when each one is approx 75 lbs and there is 3 !!!. UPS won't take them so they cannot be returned. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY !!! I learned the hard way. They literally scammed me out of over $300. The shelves cannot be used because they will twist and fall on someone ! Temu doesn't care.Edit. Temu is asking for my contact info through Trustpilot, due to fraud claims being filed with the FTC, CPA and CPSC.

684ad6a42824b505590e0d08,Karma Bytes,US,1,1,Temu served me plastic-wrapped poison…,"Temu served me plastic-wrapped poison and called it stainless steel.I bought what I thought was a set of oven-safe SUS316 stainless steel food containers. The product photos showed them going straight into ovens and microwaves. No warnings. No disclaimers. Just clean-looking metal trays that looked safe and trustworthy.But what I got was something else entirely.The trays are coated in invisible plastic. Not just inside. The entire tray is wrapped in a thin layer of clear plastic that you would never know is there. Not until it melts into your food.I melted butter in one tray. I baked cakes. I gave those cakes to people I love. The next morning, I found plastic peeling up from the inside like a skin.That’s when I realized I had unknowingly baked melted plastic into every bite.I scratched another tray and saw the plastic lift off the outside too. This is not stainless steel. This is a plastic-covered metal decoy sold as oven-safe cookware.The listing I bought from? Gone. Quietly deleted. No way to review it. No way to warn others. But now I see the same trays being sold under new listings with the same photos and the same lies.This is not an accident. This is a pattern. And it's dangerous.Temu is allowing sellers to push unsafe, falsely labeled kitchenware with no accountability. If I hadn’t caught the liner peeling up the next day, I never would have known.I have the photos. I have the regret. And now I have a warning for you.If you're thinking about buying stainless steel cookware from Temu, especially if it seems like a good deal, walk away.Because what looks like a quick bargain might come with a hidden plastic coating and a side of fear.",2025-06-12T15:31:25.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for shopping on Temu!

Tracking number was issued 3 days ago but hasn't even reached the courier company yet.Although, temu offers items with attractive discounts, but there is a catch. It keeps bombarding custmer with offers as a must to get the item, you actually want to buy, with the discount. Example : I saw something for 3 to 4 British pounds (very good price) but the app wouldn't let me checkout unless I spend atleast £15 on items temu had selected for me. Quality wise; it's not always good, depending on your luck u might get good quality or often u might not !! Plus delivery time is not ideal. Conclusion : one can get better quality with fair price and quicker delivery from other places without putting up with the annoying Temu app 😔. I can only say.... keep away, so you don't have to, like many others, go through the hassle of returning the items you bought.",2025-06-12T13:26:33.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

Temu is definitely not the dog's bullocks by any means. They sell you refurbished rebuilt reused products and call them brand new they sell you products that are built just so they will break in a relatively short amount of time or uses their customer service is 90% AI even when they say they're handing you over to a live agent that live agent just happens to be ai and at the very most it is a human being writing one paragraph followed by repeated messages written by AI and inserted by a human pushing a button their refunds they say they issue them they show you an refund issued receipt within arn number and tell you that you are supposed to contact your bank and get them to track it with this number and when you do so your bank tells you to tell them pretty much to stop effing around because they are full of shit and if there was a refund issued the refund would be in your bank and not lost somewhere in between in some imaginary digital playground taking a break before it gets to your bank account I have received one refund from these guys and they issued it the same day it hit my bank yet I am still waiting for refunds they say they've issued that are over a month old and they tell you that once it's been issued it's out of their hands and I have to contact my bank because it would be in their hands now which is not the way it works also not even legally they break the law they lie they cheat and they just don't give a crap they tell you they're going to give you something and then they say you have to buy shit first and then once you buy shit they tell you you have to buy more shit and then more shit and then more shit until your money runs out and you still haven't gotten a free gift that's going to break either before it gets to you or the first time you test it out anyway this site should be legally shut down how does as it is 100% a scam site even if they have a good front going for them just because something looks good doesn't mean it is just because something looks legal and has all the legal papers to prove it is legal doesn't mean that it is operated legally so save your phony good reviews and people out there who read reviews to base whether they'll spend their money on this place or not read them closely and if you see a five-star rating on this site know that it is probably someone that works at this place leaving a review and getting paid to do so it is the one star reviews you should start reading and then just keep reading until you get up to a five-star and notice how fake they start getting as you climb very horrible store very horrible products that is China's worst is of the worst being sold to the best of the best so that they can cheat us out of our money and then by our weapons to use against us it is the Chinese agenda after all steal the designs of our products build our products as cheap as humanly possible sell them back to us thinking we're getting a heck of a deal by buying something for a quarter the price you would over here not realizing that the materials used and the craftsmanship it was put together with or no more than paper mache and 2 month old babies temo should either be blown up with all its workers in it for having that kind of mindset or should be shut down by the proper authorities mind you the proper authorities are probably getting some kind of cut in this deal anyway because every government organization is a terrorist organization and the world should be ran by the people not by an organization,2025-06-11T20:43:51.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

The last straw was a request for payment for cloud storage that I never expected.Now when I try to complain to Yi Industries there are so many hoops and hurdles to overcome again you give up in frustration.The whole experience leaves a bad taste and puts me off every buying from Temu again.Order ID PO-069-05926559684472Ray Nipper.Slight change in as much as the seller Yi Technology has offered a 50% refund and no need to return goods. So accepting this offer but it is most unlikely I will ever use these cameras if I have to pay a monthly fee for cloud storage.So beware of this hurdle making it very difficult to avoid getting sucked into a regular payment you were not expecting.Plus more difficulties in trying to contact the seller about my problem. It was only two options to keep or return. Websites rarely make it easy to contact the sellers and create so many hurdles it's easy to just give up.Thanks for the 50% refund.,2025-06-12T08:39:52.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

They just make lame excuses.2. They claim that they pay 5€ for a delay automatically within 48 hours. I received the items late than thier expected delivery date. When i talked to thier AI, they say i should refer to thier policy. I asked to chat live with agent. I was added in a Queue with number 144 had to wait good 30 minutes and the agent created a support ticket for me. The ticket is closed by Temu and they say it was delayed due to courier and not due to them so i cannot get 5€.I am sure, they gonna reply here and ask to chat to thier agents or refer to thier policy but this is reality.Moreover, they do unnecessary buy this get this like promotions.",2025-06-11T15:43:36.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

5e97441d26eeac234b1b4c45,Alexander Smirnov,EE,5,5,Temu is great,"Temu is greatI got 41 parcels (210 items) from Temu in 17 months, ~1.2k euros. Price adjustment. A feature where you get some money back after it got cheaper during 30 days. For me it's usually around 5-10% cashback. Tracking always works. Makes you see how long customs are holding your parcel.Delivery is pretty fast (at least for me in EU), sometimes it is even faster than earliest estimate. 5 euros compensation if order isn't delivered in time. I got the compensation twice, but both ordered were send at the same time, so I could say that delay happened only once. Delay was a single day off, but still got the money.Coupons are great. I usually never use coupons, but those are very good. If you split your order nicely for coupons, you usually get 25-37.5% off everything you buy. Suggestions for Temu:Reviews:A compensation program for helpful item reviews would be great. I usually buy items with a lot of reviews, but sometimes I notice that when I leave a thorough (that gets 10+ helpful) positive review for an item with no reviews, it kickstarts sales dramatically. I wonder how much sales were made because of my positive reviews? Sharing wishlist:It would be cool if my friends and family could share their wishlists with me, so it would be easy for me to buy them something from the things they want.Edible things:I'd be happy to order some cool stuff like snacks, tea, coffee, candies.Anyway, Temu is great.",2025-06-11T15:37:20.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for your recognition.

5c1a98066598715ebc2c1166,Dom,GB,37,4,Temu is the dog's bollocks! These bad reviews are fake.,"I have bought many things from Temu since it opened and don't understand the low score on these reviews. I have received incredibly good quality items (5-10 times cheaper than on Amazon) as well as junk (hence the 4 stars instead of 5). But the junk were always refunded, most often without having to return them. If it is an expensive item, then you have (not always) to return it. Return is free. Payment of the refund is instant if you leave it on your acct at Temu. Or they refund to your initial mean of payment. This takes a few days.But the main reason why I love Temu is the phenomenal choice of items. If you are into DIY, or a fisherman, or need kitchen items, or tools, toys, bedding, gardening, music, you name it; anything is available at ridiculously low prices and often (not always) very good quality. I see some of them being sold 10x£s on amazon.It is actually very entertaining to browse those pages because they filled up with genius ideas.My only complain is that sometimes (not alway) the delivery takes long.You can buy stupid but day to day needed stuff you can't find anywhere else in small quantities. A bag of 100 elastics for £0.30. Or a replacement handle for your beloved old pan lead for £1.50. Or 150ml bottle of instant drying supper glue for £2.50. Temu is the business. I truly think that most of these bad reviews are fake. Just black propaganda. Did you notice that Amazon now offers ""refund with no return"" options? Guess why?",2025-06-11T14:53:34.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for shopping with us and sharing your 4-star experience!

They often run fake promotions, offering “free gifts” or “bonus items” to encourage more purchases — but then you get charged for those “free” items, and it’s not always obvious on the bill.In my last order, I intended to spend around $65, but Temu charged my account $144. After speaking with customer service via chat, I was told that I had supposedly purchased extra items I didn’t want or select. They were added to my cart without my knowledge.In another instance, I simply opened the Temu app late at night without placing an order — and they still charged my account for something I never bought.Customers don’t always have a chance to catch these sneaky charges in time.

It is quick to refund and the process of making a claim is simple and straight forward. However, it is very much a case of 'Buyer Beware'! Countless others have mentioned the poor quality of the goods offered so there is little need for me to add my own words of caution here.Ignore all the 'Special Offer', 'Huge Discount', '70% Off' statements as the RRP are hugely exaggerated. In fact I haven't found one item advertised at the suggested TEMU RRP anywhere else. Furthermore, be careful on the 'special price' offered, and check elsewhere. I found 10mm round headed gold coloured nails at £5.00 for 100 with a recommended retail price (RRP) of £18.03 on TEMU, and 300 of the same nails for £5.52 on Amazon!Update: TEMU have responded to my review and, as I stated right from the start, they are very good at looking after their customers with a quick and simple refund system, which works very well In their reply they have offered me a complete refund for any faulty goods I have received.

633953715a9ecb00128d1357,Ann Kelly,GB,3,1,"Misleading Product, Poor Quality and Awful Customer Service - Never Again","I ordered what was advertised as a Velvet Outdoor Lounge Set from TEMU on 8th May 2025, valued at £34.50. The listing clearly showed and described chairs, a table, and a mat – which I genuinely believed I would receive. What arrived on 9th June, after a month-long wait, was just a single mat/carpet. How can that possibly be worth £34.50?This product was part of a free gift promotion, where I had to spend over £35 on other items to qualify for 5 ""free gifts."" The lounge set was the one item I was really looking forward to – it seemed like a fantastic deal. Unfortunately, all the items and so-called gifts I received were extremely poor quality and not worth the money at all.This mat was the final straw. I’ve spent hundreds of pounds with TEMU over the last year, but after this experience, I will never order from them again.Their customer service is horrendous – nothing but repetitive responses from what seems like an AI bot. No genuine human help. They only offer credit notes, not proper refunds, which is unacceptable. I strongly believe this is a case of false advertising and product manipulation and TEMU should be investigated under the Trade Descriptions Act.Overall, TEMU sells cheap, low-value goods disguised with attractive photos and misleading descriptions. I would advise everyone to think twice before spending their money. I’m deleting the app and won’t be coming back.",2025-06-10T09:19:39.000Z,,"Hello Ann, thank you for reaching out to us.

First order included a roll of thin copper sheet, the second 4 sheets of A3 laser marking paper.

I managed to sort the copper roll out but the paper is unusable.I asked for a refund for the paper and got it straight away. However, I will not order from Temu again as it appears to be more likely that as a result of poor packaging my purchases will arrive damaged.

6847be5af0e9f320976a56be,Mike O,GB,1,1,Temu advert (google play),"Greetings . In general I have found shopping with Temu to be tolerable, however getting issues fixed does take time. My major gripe this time is that, have played a game on google play a Temu adverts comes up stating if you down load the app from the link on the ad you can get an Android Tablet with accessories for free. In reality there is no Tablet on offer you have to spend £50.00 in order to get 6 free gifts while thqat might seem a good deal, The fact remains there is no tablet anywhere near the same as the one suggested in the advert available. This is quite frankly , misleading, inaccurate and unethical. I have no doubt that inthe small print under rules etc which are not easily visible ;they will some how wriggle out of responsibility like the slippery eels they are. So please beware of such ads. The old saying, If it seems to good to be true, It probably will be . Take care out there . NB. I have no doubt this will be followed up by a pointless generic fob off and even worse a false apology. I very much doubt anything i have posted will be read by the unfortunate agent that gets lumbered with this . Sappers do not roll over UBIQUE !! ...Update 14.6.25 . Despite several communications with Temu. They have done nothing to address this issue. However I did get this reply from the agent I spoke with on the website ..'We can totally understand why you're feeling disappointed and frustrated with the misleading advertising you've encountered, especially with multiple fake adverts that have affected your trust in us. If we were in your shoes, we would feel the same way, and we're truly sorry for all the inconvenience and distress this has caused you, leading to your decision to close your account.' I doubt anything will change I have no trust in this company at all . Please tread carefully with them. Kind Regards Mike O' I have already contacted Temu support, they did nothing, I gave them fair warning that if they did not honour the advert I would report Temu and give negative feed back here on Trustpilot",2025-06-14T04:31:23.000Z,,"Hello Mike, thank you for participating in our promotional activities and we are sorry that you are experiencing difficulties with your rewards.

But one small, easily correctable mistake — choosing the wrong color for a free gift — revealed something deeper: Temu does not care about customer satisfaction.I contacted customer service within minutes of placing the order, asking for a simple change. I was respectful, clear, and even offered a fair solution: cancel the item and provide store credit so I could re-order the correct version.Despite multiple attempts, and even asking to speak to a supervisor, I kept receiving the same copy-paste response — just from different agents. No one genuinely listened. No one actually tried to help. It was all scripted replies and “policy-based” excuses.Let me be clear: this is not about a £15 gift.It’s about how a company handles mistakes, values its customers, and whether it puts empathy before rigid rules.Frankly, I’m shocked that a platform as large as Temu would risk losing a loyal customer over something so minor. If they can’t solve a basic request like this, how can anyone trust them with more serious issues?I’m now sharing this publicly so others can be aware of how Temu really operates when things go wrong.",2025-06-09T10:37:40.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

67fec9a8a8b3e61f4d9bcef4,Ali Rajabi,GB,1,1,Somebody sue this company,"Absolute horrible service. Personal belongings got damaged by a product. Not my fault. Contacted their customer service multiple times. They created me a ticket. They asked for evidence and in such a way to make it impossible. For example my coat was ruined by a waterproofing spray. They asked for a pictures. That’s fine. Then they make you wait. I have waited for over 4 months. Every day I message them on the ticket. They’re meant to reply within 24 hours but sometimes they take up to 2 days and sometimes they don’t even reply till you message again. After these 4 painful months of going back and fourth they ask for a damage report. Where do I get that from? Seriously? I did eventually get 1 after paying a company. Then they asked for proof of purchase to confirm the price (expensive jacket). AFTER ALL THIS, they offer £150. £150. Not in money but in credit. I’ve been trying to raise this. No. It won’t go up no matter what even though the coat costs £500 (arcteryx) and is ruined. Funny thing is their terms and conditions clearly state they are liable for all damages. I don’t even know how they havnt been shut down and sued. When I tried contacting their legal department through the email listed for that department they say it’s not for the uk? Yes it is. They’re lying. Then they say go through the app. How am I meant to go to your legal department through the app? They’re just trying to down play it. Temu I have seen your responses to these trustpilot reviews,”contact customer services on app”. I have. They don’t help. Genuinley if you don’t help me somehow else like through a different way to contact you because your customer service will not help no matter what I will take this up legally. Not only that but their customer service now uses translation making it even worse and inaccurate. And don’t get me started on the reaction times. I kid you not it’s close to 8 minutes per reply on a “ live chat”. Temu is absolute 💩 don’t use it!Edit: it’s been a few days since I’ve posted this review and Temu responded immediately asking for more info to follow up. They never did. They told me to contact customer service. Guess what. They did nothing and did not care AT ALL. There reply’s on Trustpilot are just for show not help. Please if a lawyer reads this sue them. They do not follow their own policies. Packages lost and terms clearly states its temus sole responsibility for the delivery to be succesful. But what do they do? They force you to contact the courrier and look for it. If you can’t do that or they don’t help you say goodbye to your money.

Customer service is nothing short of disgusting, orders take around two months to arrive if they are ever sent. I requested a full refund of all my outstanding orders which never made it passed the picking stage the told them to shove it and will never buy anything on Temu again.Temu's reply to all customer complaints is alway about how important customer satisfaction is, in reality they couldn't care less and just give you the same robotic BS and fob you off with excuses that make no sense. As an perfect example, read their BS reply. More worthless and pointless dribble about how much they care, pity they don't care when you contact them directly though, it's not much to ask that they just deliver the goods that I paid for on time!?",2025-06-06T06:13:31.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out and we are sorry that you are experiencing difficulties with your order.

On 5/24 their were 4 more transactions made that i know i didn't place or authorize. A total of $135.71. Things i wouldn't order or spend that much money on. They keep saying i did and found no issue on there end. Why would I lie!!?? I tried telling them when I first noticed a pool being shipped. I want my money back and they can send someone here to pick this heavy stuff up because I'm unable to! They will scam you eventually, some things are to good to be true!! A pool, a hammock, some clothesline, 10 plastic containers, king size heavy duty vinyl tarp. I wouldn't order these things!!! And why wouldn't I place those items with my order on the 23rd if I truly wanted them? They will not take ownership of the error on there end! Its scary they will do this and say it's totally your fault! Something happened on Temu's end. I only placed 1 order for some flowers, flower seeds, a book and some oil. The next day I noticed a pool saying it shipped! I looked into Temu and seen not only a pool, but a hammock, they were there most expensive but seen other items as well that i didn't order. I immediately contacted them to STOP those shipments and that I did not order those items. They said they have investigate and assured me it would be taken care of. Well they shipped. They said I could return the items but they are heavy and don't live close to a shipping station. I told them all that! Chatted with their customer service for 3 days to stop them, i didn't order them but they shipped them anyways. They need to be stopped, Im sure this has happened to others! They since refunded the hammock without a return however, Im still stuck with those other items I did not order. They said nothing happened on their end. WRONG! It did! I'm extremely upset, I don't like being called a liar and they need to refund me for all those other items I did not order! So, please everyone be very very careful it will happen to you! They could've stopped all those items from being shipped as soon as I contacted them however, their so called ""investigation"" let it happen!

This wasn’t a one-time event. It happened repeatedly over three months. I’ve documented everything — including photos and my conversations with my general practitioner.Temu’s response?Generic copy-paste replies, emojis, and empty apologies. When I asked them to acknowledge the harm caused by their products, they demanded an ""official allergy report"" — something nearly impossible to obtain when your doctor doesn’t even know what unregulated chemicals are in the products.My GP refused to run any specific tests, saying:> “I don’t know which chemicals are in it, so I can’t test it.”So here I am — stuck with skin damage, no accountability, and a company that cares more about PR than people.❗This is not just about one customer. Many people are reporting similar issues — chemical smells, allergic reactions, suspicious materials. Temu floods the market with cheap, unregulated products, and no one is answering for the consequences.I was poisoned slowly over 3 months by their products and now have to deal with the aftermath and they don’t care.Please, be cautious.

I have been a Temu customer for more than 3 years and have ordered products in the range of 2000€. Everything seemed to be perfect but in the past year I have experienced a number of issues. Late delivery, incomplete orders, misleading product listings, increase in lead time etc. But the worst is when I log into the app there is always a “reward or excellent product discounts”, when checking the products they in fact have an enormous discount, some even have discounts of 70% but beware! These discounts are fraudulent as the products are on a selected page and the customer is not able to see the real price in normal circumstances. For example they advertise an item for 20€ with a 50% discount dropping the price to 10€, the customer seems satisfied with this discount but in reality there is no discount because if you search the app for the same product on the main page you will see that in fact there is absolutely no discount. What they do is double the price of the item and issue you. 50% discount. This is fraud. Customers beware. Temu is not what it used to be when they started off.

I made an order and then when I put it through I was offered £170 worth of credits but just needed a few coins to reach the 200 credits, the threshold was £10 but I made an order a bit more than that, so a bar appears at the bottom of your screen which starts filling up when you reach enough credits (or so it makes you believe) but then when I put my order through I will still not at the 200 credits, so giving it the benefit of the doubt I made another order over £10 and again the bar filled up and yet again once I placed the order I still hadn’t reached the 200 credits, even though the bar at the bottom was filling up! I decided to speak to an Agent who then told me that I would need to spend at least £149 to receive the £170 worth of credits.. at this point I was so angry, so I read through the rules and nowhere in the rules does it tell you this..

5849b7010000ff000a5f9ea6,James Greyson,GB,3,1,Zero interest in protecting their possibly bleeding workers,"Excellent quality in about 1/3 items. Another 1/3 ok and 1/3 unusable (defective, broken or misdescribed) which is manageable due to low prices, free returns and helpful live chat. Temu are used by many sellers for warehouse clearance of second-quality stock so Temu should update their business model to include an option to buy seconds cheaper, rather than pretending that everything is the same high quality. However they deserve 1 star or less for ignoring my report of an item with apparent spots of blood around the lid (shining under UV light). Customer service opened a ticket a week ago but have since sent only repeated auto-type replies (""If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact us"") whilst totally ignoring all my questions about the possible worker bleeding whilst making items for them. They have a public ethical policy although it may not be operating at all since my email to the reporting address it gives was picked up by a US after-sales bot 'we are unable to access your account information from the country/region you are currently contacting us from'. Temu show zero capability for handling a serious worker safety report so I assume zero interest in worker safety and zero action being taken to investigate the factory or protect their possibly bleeding workers. Edit after temu's reply (below). Temu focus on the product, which was of course not the problem (they already kindly refunded). Totally looking the other way when there is blood on items probably means it's not just a matter of a worker forgetting their gloves one day. It may mean their ethical policy is unimplemented, temu is investigating nothing and the temu should themselves be rigorously investigated to establish the extent of any temu supplier workforce mistreatment.Edit after trustpilot contacted me for purchase order and telephone info to respond to temu's apparent request for my review to be removed as non-genuine. Temu know it's genuine as I've been discussing the issue with them daily since may 25th on a customer service ticket in my name.Edit after temu closed my customer service ticket with no acknowledgement or solution for anything I raised. 15 auto-responses in reply to my 12 detailed respectful questions. They invited a review of their service, I wrote...Uncaring and bad business. Shameful.Closed the ticket without any meaningful response on any of the 5 issues raised. Temu should be able to discuss all 5 but attempted zero. The irony is that all the issues are good for temu to solve, but bad for business and reputation to ignore.

5c49c5444f06b9a08bfd4b5e,PLS,GB,33,1,Really Bad. They do not care about clients. Just money,"Really Bad. 2nd order made ""Order time: Apr 21, 2025, Order ID: PO-186-16897124262951540"", 2nd time they completely messed it up. Once again the package did not arrive. TEMU FAILED AGAIN. Back in April I made an order. As a condition to the order I advised that I would be in Hospital until 27th May (due to a knee replacement operation. Obviously I cannot walk far). I asked for delivery to my home address, on or after 28th May AND U requested that the delivery company call me beforehand by telephone. When I arrived home the stupid delivery company lied and said they had trieded to deliver twice BEFORE 28th May! No calls were received. IDIOTS!. I called the delivery company, they talked over me, were very rude, and hung up the telephone. I contacted and emailed TEMU 8 times, but they did nothing as usual, A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME. Every day I get an email stating ""my package is waiting for me to collect it"" & ""Get in touch with the delivery company""!!!!! FOOLS, HOW AM I GOING TO COLLECT IT? I sent them a photo of my operated knee. They did not bother to reply. The delivery company have a simple garage attached to a private house, in Vecindario, it is some an hour away from my home! I CANNOT WALK!!! IDIOTS. The delivery company Hispapost have over 15000 bad reviews for ""non-delivery"" and lies on TrustPilot! Once again, I will not be receiving anything from TEMU. They do not care about their clients. They have cheated me out of my money, wasted my time and caused me a lot of stress. Last week, I instructed my lawyer to claim damages against TEMU in the Las Palmas de Gran Canaria Small Claims Court. I would not recommend TEMU to anyone. They seem like a good business, but they are let down by terrible delivery companies and bad/disinterested Client Services. Paul Lee STAINTON X2437784Z3rd June 2025Muy mal. Segundo pedido realizado ""Fecha de pedido: 21 de abril de 2025, ID de pedido: PO-186-16897124262951540"", y la segunda vez lo arruinaron por completo. Una vez más, el paquete no llegó. TEMU FALLÓ DE NUEVO.En abril hice un pedido. Como condición para el pedido, informé que estaría hospitalizado hasta el 27 de mayo (debido a una operación de reemplazo de rodilla. Obviamente, no puedo caminar mucho).Pedí la entrega a mi domicilio el 28 de mayo o después, y solicité que la empresa de reparto me llamara por teléfono antes.Cuando llegué a casa, la estúpida empresa de reparto mintió y dijo que habían intentado entregar dos veces ¡ANTES del 28 de mayo! No recibí ninguna llamada. ¡IDIOTAS!Llamé a la empresa de reparto, me interrumpieron, fueron muy groseros y colgaron el teléfono. Contacté y escribí a TEMU 8 veces, pero no hicieron nada, como siempre. ¡UNA PÉRDIDA DE TIEMPO!Todos los días recibo un correo que dice ""Mi paquete está esperando a que lo recoja"" y ""¡Ponte en contacto con la empresa de reparto!"".¡TONTOS! ¿CÓMO VOY A RECOGERLO? Les envié una foto de mi rodilla operada. Ni se molestaron en responder. La empresa de reparto tiene un sencillo garaje junto a una casa particular en Vecindario, ¡a una hora de mi casa! ¡NO PUEDO ANDAR! ¡IDIOTAS! La empresa de reparto Hispapost tiene más de 15.000 malas reseñas por ""no entrega"" y miente en TrustPilot.Una vez más, no recibiré nada de TEMU. No les importan sus clientes. Me han estafado, me han hecho perder el tiempo y me han causado mucho estrés.La semana pasada, le di instrucciones a mi abogado para que reclamara daños y perjuicios a TEMU en el Juzgado de Menor Cuantía de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. No recomendaría TEMU a nadie. Parecen un buen negocio, pero se ven decepcionados por sus pésimas empresas de reparto y su servicio al cliente deficiente y desinteresado.Paul Lee STAINTON X2437784Z3 de junio de 2025Update:3rd June 2025Now TEMU are ""checking and checking"" but they do not actually do anything to resolve the situation.

I waited a month, it came to my country and finally Temu refused to deliver it to my city. I needed it for my upcoming trip in a few days, so it ruined my experience. Their support said it will be delivered and to contact the courier, then another support agent said it won't be delivered.They offered 20% discount up to 39 BGN on all orders. After making a small order just to test it, I got a 9 BGN discount. I wanted to use the rest 30 BGN discount that was promised but Temu support refused that. I spent literally over 3 hours chatting with them, they were very unprofessional and sent only copy-paste generic responses. I insisted to escalate it to a manager and they made a ticket which was closed within 1 min. with the same copy-paste response from a 'senior' who obviously hadn't even read my message. Then I insisted to make another ticket 1748375493032845, but got the same copy-paste messages, with the exception that this time they make me wait a day to get each of their copy-paste responses that don't help at all.All in all, Temu's customer support has degraded dramatically in the recent months.

In Canada, they use a delivery service called PDN Express, which has numerous negative reviews and a reputation for questionable practices. In my case, they falsely marked my package as delivered when it never arrived. It's frustrating that Temu continues to partner with such an unreliable carrier.

50bfd5f80000640001292264,Pascale,BE,128,1,Even 1 star is too much!!,"Even 1 star is too much!!! Absolutely outrageous service — 3 hours wasted, then she disappeared.I spent over 3 hours in the Timu customer service chat today trying to solve a very simple issue.I placed ONE order, which Timu decided to split into THREE separate packages. Now I want to return some items, but the website only allows one free return and only shows two of the three packages — so I cannot combine everything into a single return. That means I’d have to pay out of pocket to ship part of my return back to China, which can cost €80+. I refuse to do that.I explained the situation calmly, clearly, and repeatedly. I even sent screenshots and detailed messages (written with help from ChatGPT to avoid confusion). I broke it down into small parts to make it easier for the agent to understand. But she didn’t answer a single one of my questions. Not one.All she did in 3 hours was refund me for one broken cat fountain. That’s it.Then, after 3 hours of chat, and without warning, she suddenly asked, “Are you still there?”Yes, I was — I had just gone to the bathroom for 3 minutes. When I came back, she was gone. No goodbye. No warning. No solution.And I’m left with a large return I can’t process and a situation she never resolved. I feel like I’m living in a twilight zone. It’s surreal. How can you be in customer service and just vanish after 3 hours of ignoring someone?This is not customer service. This is a broken, robotic, scripted system that wastes your time and leaves you worse off than when you started.Timu: you wasted my entire Sunday evening.This experience was outrageous.And, she ignored ALL my very clear structured messages......and offered in those 3 hours not 1 solution. So now I'm stuck. I need to return it, the website doesn't allow it and I'm not paying for the items I want to return and certainly not paying for any shipping cost of the return package. ------------Update in response to Timu’s reply:You asked for additional information, and I’ve filled in what I can — but please note: your system only allows one order number, while this issue involves three separate packages from a single order.The core issue remains unresolved:I spent over three hours in chat with your customer service explaining this problem in detail — that your website only allows one free return and doesn’t let me combine items from all three packages. I cannot return everything without paying high shipping costs, and I was offered no solution.Yes, I was refunded for a broken cat fountain — but that wasn’t the main issue. The refund was delayed because your team kept asking multiple times how I wanted to receive it, even though I clearly said twice: via the original payment method.After all that, I was told the “problem was solved” — because I don’t need to return the broken item. But the actual problem — the return of multiple packages — was never addressed. I’m still stuck.I honestly wonder if your support staff even read the structured messages I sent — because I repeated myself clearly and calmly for hours. And still: no answers. Just delays, copy-paste replies, and more confusion.You wasted my Sunday evening, and now you’re wasting my time again. Please escalate this to someone who can offer an actual solution. I have a surgery this week and cannot keep repeating myself endlessly.----------Update for TEMU to your reply: Update:Thanks for your reply, but I’ve already explained my situation multiple times and never received real support. This message is clearly automated and doesn't acknowledge the actual issue. If you truly care about customer satisfaction, read what I wrote and respond accordingly.-------------------Review:Today is June 2nd. I went back into the Temu chatroom again to try and resolve an issue with a simple return.Once again, they ignored everything I said, repeated prefab answers, and told me to “wait 24 hours” for the higher department to respond. I told them, repeatedly, that I am having back surgery in 24 hours, and will not be able to contact them, coz I'm in the OR and return the package afterward because I won’t be able to walk.She kept ignoring thisI explained it calmly, then clearly, then urgently. They just kept saying, “we understand, but you have to wait.” Wait for what? For your mistake to become my burden?I offered to donate the pillow I can’t return. I uploaded screenshots. I solved most of it myself, without their help. And still, no resolution—only robotic replies and zero accountability.Temu, your customer service is a disaster. It doesn’t listen. It doesn’t act. It doesn’t care.And Giovanna R. is by far the most unhelpful, inattentive customer agent I’ve dealt with. But so are the others I had to deal with. Yesterday and today.Case closed.I’m sending the returns tomorrow, without their so-called help.",2025-06-02T13:00:51.000Z,,"Hello Pascale, thank you for reaching out to us.

They rarely give details about the item and or accurate specifications. They advertise things like real leather, real this or that, but most of the time is not even real, but synthetic stuff. I have had good stuff from Temu, but it is a hit and miss. Recently I bought items for my business to use as merchandise, over £400 worth, and only 50% of it I would use without feeling embarrassed about it. The rest is junk. I have returned a few things for a full refund. I have now learnt not to expect a lot from Temu, and if the item is similar price elsewhere, then I will not buy from Temu, as they take forever to get the items to us and it may not even be as expected.

BE WARNED if you place an item in your cart the price will change and go up. By the time you check out it may double in price. I have checked and checked and still got caught out with the price altering - they call it a sale or lightening sale. SO just be warned I recently put something in my cart at $45 still that when I approved payment then after payment it was $115. Difficult to cancel order at that point as payment has already been taken. Returning objects can also be a nightmare as you have to drop it to the closest collection point which is only open during office hours and can be an hour away.

They ship your packages in little plastic bags with the tiny ones not making it though the mail. I though at first they were being stolen and asked the mail delivery to leave them at my door. This was ignored so, I contacted Temu and asked them to send a notice with my packages to leave them at my door, and to please box the items so less will get lost in the mail. They just give you the run around with no results. So, every time a package does not arrive when they say it has been delivered, Temu give you the run around when requesting a refund. They want proof! There is no proof! It did not arrive!! So, the result is no refund. Then you take it to customer service who gives you lip service. Also no results.

66b5c292ce77db0ce6f475bd,Lorraine Harvey,CA,2,1,Buyer Beware,"I purchased two night tables which were advertised as ""local."" I paid for them but when I received confirmation of the sale, there was $72 in import duties charged. I complained, and indicated that I would be returning them. I was instructed to arrange for the shipping, pay for it, and I would be reimbursed, but they only reimbursed me for the cost of the items, not the duty and not the shipping charges. it took several weeks to get the refund and I am now arguing with them over the shipping charges and the duty. They now say that I will not receive a refund on the duty because it was not their fault nor was it the fault of the manufacturer. However, it was advertised as “Local” which to me means it’s in my country or my city and therefore I should not have had to pay duty. It’s actually kind of interesting because when I was initiating the complaint, their agents agreed that it said local but still denied that they were responsible. I think they just try to out-wait you and hope you’ll go away.There is an update to the above. Perhaps due to my persistence, TEMU has now processed a credit equal to the return shipping charges, but still take no responsibility for the fact the the item was described as ""Local"" yet was actually shipped from the US which resulted in import charges. I will likely use up this credit but after that is gone, do not think I will deal with them again because they are not particularly good at taking responsibility for their own errors.My best advice is not to buy anything too expensive from them so you won't experience what I went through.",2025-05-31T18:05:25.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

64f96e2f3eb8ec00120a9126,TN,AU,3,1,Will Not Be Ordering Again from Temu in a Hurry - Order ID: PO-012-[REDACTED NUMBER HERE],"i ordered a 4TB USB HDD from temu (Order ID: PO-012-[REDACTED NUMBER HERE]). this item was intended as a gift.today the temu package arrived and it was not the item that i had ordered and paid for. instead of the 4 TB HDD i had ordered, i received an SSD device - a completely different item, and not what i wanted.so now i have an item that i cannot use as the gift i had intended.i go online and request a refund using temu's 'request a refund' (non-human) process. i complete all the online prompts and reach the 'print return label' section.this does not bode well.i do not have a printer, and i am certainly not interested in purchasing one just to print a return label for an item that was mistakenly posted to me. furthermore, having increasingly problematic chronic groin pain (as a result of 3 bilateral groin surgeries), i have enough trouble going to the WC, let alone outside of my residence.there is no facility online to request that temu or the seller send me a return label by post, which i can then attach to the item and then have the postal worker that delivers my mail to my residence take the package for a return.temu's online links take me to an automated chat system that instructs me to go to a post office or library etc. to print the label. this is not an option for me or generally for people with disabilities or impairments of one kind or another.the seller sent me the wrong item - it is their responsibility, not the buyers' to jump through hoops.in fact, the buyer, in addition to receiving an immediate refund, should be compensated for having their time and effort wasted due to seller-instigated errors.i will be issuing a charge-back request if i do not receive an immediate refund, and i will not be inclined to purchase any further items from temu. this is my second purchase from temu, and we already have a 50% strike (or error) rate - not good.if temu read this, please don't bother asking me to go online (again), or use the temu app. - i have already been online searching for help to no avail - and i will not be wasting any more of my time.very disappointed.------------------------------------AN UPDATE - JUNE 2, 2025------------------------------------after writing the aforementioned review a few days ago i received an e-mail from TRUSTPILOT asking me to click a link in the same e-mail as TEMU apparently wanted a little more information regarding my TRUSTPILOT review above.i clicked the link and was taken to a page asking me for my full name, temu order number/ID, and my telephone number.i completed the online form.today (june 2, 2025) i received an e-mail from my payment processor indicating that a full refund of my temu purchase has been issued, and an e-mail from TEMU HELP (help [AT] service.temu.com) apologizing for the events following my purchase.---------------------------------MY TAKE-HOME MESSAGE:---------------------------------if you have a genuine grievance, take the time to go online and create a TRUSTPILOT (or other review site) review.even if your complaint is not resolved to your satisfaction, other (potential) buyers may find your experience(s) useful.best wishes.oh, i have redacted my temu Order ID that i provided in my original review above just to be safe.have a good day.",2025-06-13T13:12:45.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

683879272824b51ee3fab65c,Filippos,CY,1,1,Temu Ignores EU Law – Escalated to ECC Cyprus,"[UPDATE – June 27, 2025] – Store credit granted, but only after EU intervention.The case has now been officially filed with the Small Claims Court, in addition to the ongoing investigation by ECC Cyprus and the Irish CCPC.This step was necessary due to Temu’s ongoing refusal to comply with EU Directive 2011/83 – Article 16, regarding store credit for non-returnable cosmetic items.📌 After 74 days, and only after the ECC escalated the matter, Temu finally issued a €24.16 store credit. No apology. No acknowledgment of wrongdoing. Just silence — once they knew the ECC was involved.All documentation has been submitted to both the ECC and the District Court. The case remains registered and pending before a judicial authority.📢 I’ve publicly documented the full process: 👉 @Filippos1438411⚠️ If you’re an EU customer: don’t rely on luck or “customer service.” You may need to involve official bodies to get what you're entitled to by law.✅ I promised I wouldn’t give up — and I didn’t. Not until the law was respected. No bots, no excuses.Update (May 30, 2025):Thank you for your generic response. However, my complaint concerns a legal matter under EU Directive 2011/83/EE and has already been escalated to the European Consumer Centre (ECC) Cyprus.I urge Temu to stop sending automated replies and instead escalate this case to a supervisor or legal department.Customer satisfaction cannot be achieved if you disregard EU consumer rights.This matter is not about a refund alone — it’s about respecting EU law and consumer protection.",2025-06-27T09:41:14.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

6838410d2f2478bcaf05cf91,Anonymous,US,1,1,Deceptive Promotion and Refusal to Honor,"I placed an order through Temu’s app with a promotion offering 3 gifts for $0.01 each. My transaction page clearly showed the gifts and said “Checkout for gifts.” No terms, no disclaimers, just a banner confirming the offer.After paying, the gifts never never appeared in my order. I contacted support and went through four tiers of reps, all giving me the same copy/paste excuse that I didn’t qualify, even though my receipt clearly shows I did.This is a classic bait-and-switch. Temu used a fake promo to drive a sale and refused to honor it. That’s deceptive and unethical.I’m asking Temu to make it right: send the 3 items at the promised price. If not, I’ll keep sharing this experience and filing complaints. Customers deserve honesty, not tricks.",2025-05-29T13:13:36.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for participating in our promotional activities and we are sorry that you are experiencing difficulties with your rewards.

6821356a75d981da0382fd27,mark roberts,AU,5,1,May 2025,"Update, a reply to Temu's feedbackFirst, I dont believe for one second Temu is ""sorry I'm not satisfied with some of my items. Second, not some goods, all of them! I can forward photos to you and Trustpilot if you like and you can compare to Temu's website. Take the time to look at the pictures I posted and tell me that you would find these products acceptable. Third is a lie: clearly you do not have any quality control. If you did you would not have dared sent this rubbish, and to be clear, I mean goods that look absolutely nothing like the photos on your website. In fact, I would go as far as to say that what you are doing is fraud. A couple of months ago, I bought a rug and it is satisfactory - not great but ok - this time, however, the quality of the goods $150 worth of goods is so bad, so awful i've requested refunds (I have photos!). The problem is Temu only allows one refund per delivery, and one return. Ah ha! got ya! haven't they. You might occasionally get lucky but odds are most goods on Temu are rubbish; and if you must order from them I would advise that you only order one item at a time. That way you stand a better chance of getting a refund without all the hassle of making a return - who has the time? - and of course Temu banks on that very fact. Rubbish, rubbish, rubbish. And, finally, if anyone customer is reading this, Temuballows for one refund and one return per order. So if you buy a bundle of stuff, which I'm sure a lot of people do, you can only claim a small partial refund; you lose no matter how Temu wants to 'redirects your attention.",2025-05-29T12:38:50.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for shopping on Temu!

5d650f0a48da2a6d3df9bdf9,Dominic Meli,GB,4,1,DO NOT SHOP WITH TEMU.,"This is the third time my leaving this review. Temu and trustpilot have worked in collusion to keep removing my honest review and making it generally hard to leave another, but persistence is key and I've found a way. I bought a composter from temu which arrived with a wrong part and temu helpline message service almost drove me around the bend with repeated questions and swapping operatives so I had to explain myself over and over. I got an email from them saying how they take it seriously bs bs bs because that was ages ago and I've heard nothing since. I also tried ordering the part, but an awkward seller chose to reply at a snails pace and at one point I couldn't return it or get the part and I finally got a refund which was enough to take to a local engineering firm and have the incorrect piece altered so that it would fit. But the whole process was an absolute nightmare and as a result, I would strongly advise anyone against shopping with temu, the more expensive products are the same as anywhere else, but the smaller stuff tends to be a bit naf, but their customer services leave a hell of a lot to be desired, they literally had me wanting to pull my hair out and I honestly cannot remember the last time I have felt so LIVID because of some idiot in the wrong job asking me the same questions over and over and it was deliberate which was absolutely crystal clear if you could read the chat. Anyway, just don't shop here and temu, here is the number you keep asking for again. I'm sure you'll have it deleted by your trusty the lapdog and so I'll see you in the 4th negative review. PO-210-21616529807912082UPDATE, you complain about their chat facility and customer services and temu then ask you tou put yourself through it again where you'd have to explain the whole thing to them and still get nowhere. Temu customer services will frustrate you beyond reasonable. Just do yourself a favour and don't ever shop with them. They really don't care about their customers. And I'm not reaching out to you temu, I'm reviewing you on trustpilot to expose you, but its like I've said already, you're in collusion with them",2025-05-29T09:41:12.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

64f6cea7a3eb7f00123ccc61,Fiona Mitchell,GB,5,1,Cheap tat.,"Simply, the misinformation. I thought I would have a look and, while I was expecting poor quality, I really didn’t expect it to be this bad.

6835546e8a53751724518e64,Patrick Ziegler,FR,1,1,Terrible customer service and failed delivery – never ordering from Temu again,"I placed an order with Temu that was supposed to be redelivered on May 24th. As of today, nothing has arrived. No one answers the phone, the delivery driver ignores repeated calls, and customer support has been utterly unhelpful.The first agent I spoke with didn’t even realize the tracking system had the wrong address. I had to ask twice before they finally checked. No wonder the package never showed up.To make matters worse, I received a call from the delivery company five days ago, asking if I spoke Thai and saying they couldn’t locate my address. Clearly, the item was already out for delivery, yet Temu completely failed to manage the situation.This order was meant as a surprise for my daughter, and Temu’s incompetence has ruined it.I’ve now deleted my Temu account and will never order from them again. I’ll also be sharing this experience on the Apple App Store, Google Play, and other review platforms to warn others.Final verdict: A complete waste of time, full of frustration, and a shocking lack of accountability.Update, 28.05.2025: After multiple emails, phone calls, and a completely failed redelivery, Temu only bothered to respond AFTER I posted a negative review on Trustpilot. That alone speaks volumes about how seriously they take customer service.What did I get? A token “compensation” of ฿70 credit (barely €2) and a 20% discount coupon — not as an apology, but clearly as a thinly veiled sales tactic.Let’s be clear:This is not compensation — this is a manipulative push to make me place another order, even though the first package still hasn’t arrived. To make matters worse, the coupon is only valid until May 31st, essentially pressuring me to buy again within a week, or lose it. That’s not customer support — that’s predatory marketing.And still: no package, no apology, no real solution.This entire experience has been appalling. What was meant to be a special surprise for my daughter has turned into a time-consuming mess of frustration, delays, and indifference. I’ve already deleted my Temu account, and I will continue warning others on YouTube and other review platforms.If you’re thinking about ordering from Temu, ask yourself:Are you ready to be ignored, gaslighted, and handed a promo coupon instead of real help?I wasn’t — and I won’t be coming back.",2025-05-28T04:32:07.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

67eb105489ee14f5fb508220,Diana,LV,2,2,I’ve had multiple frustrating…,"I’ve had multiple frustrating experiences with Temu’s promotions.First, I participated in a cashback event where users were supposed to log in daily to claim rewards. I did log in every day, but the app showed an error and didn’t let me claim the bonus. I contacted support, and they acknowledged the issue and promised to credit the bonuses manually. But that never happened. Later, they changed their story and claimed I had received the rewards which is completely false.And just today they offered me to add just 15€ instead of 45€, which I had to get. Second, I used Temu’s official “price adjustment” feature on a previous order. After that, I was silently banned from participating in promotions without any warning or explanation. This condition wasn’t mentioned in any promo terms, and support again denied responsibility.It feels like Temu blocks users from rewards as soon as they actually stand to benefit. Their support keeps changing narratives, ignoring facts, and avoiding responsibility.Very disappointing and dishonest.",2025-05-26T22:54:55.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out, and we apologize that you are experiencing issues with our promotions.

Yet this is just one bag and there is 10 or even 100 seller selling them. I guess others can be good, so it's again about luck. Except electric stuff... Never order anything that can melt in your power outlet.I also ordered guitar wall mounts, but only for my old GuitarHero and RockBand guitars to use them as decor.

6809237f3e76a49bbeaacfed,No,US,1,1,Temu’s new shipping scam is a trap—don’t fall for it. I would give it zero stars if that was a choice.,"Would give no stars if I could.Temu used to be fun. Now it’s just a trap.They’ve silently changed their policies so that shipping fees apply per seller, and you only get free shipping if you spend over $30 from a single store. That means if you buy two tiny items from two shops—say, a $0.32 keychain and a $3 clearance item—you’ll get hit with $6 in shipping fees. I had a $2.45 credit and still had to pay more than my entire cart just to check out.I tried customer service. I was passed around for nearly an hour, only to get vague apologies and a copy-paste explanation about “different warehouses.” No actual resolution. Just more stalling.Temu has turned into a fee-harvesting machine. This new model preys on casual buyers who won’t notice they’re being overcharged until checkout. It’s deceptive, it’s manipulative, and it’s intentional.I’ll be deleting my account, and I strongly suggest you read the fine print before giving them your time or money. They’ve gone from discount shopping to scam-tier bait-and-switch.I would also like to know that this is not the first time this has happened so this is what prompted me/this was my final straw because they’re incredibly predatory and they are a wolf in sheep’s clothing.",2025-05-26T17:14:55.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

When it comes to our UK consumer laws, let me be clear they do not abide so avoid unless you want to get ripped off!!Added: ask to speak to an agent as soon as to you talk to customer service otherwise you're talking to a robot it makes no difference with my solution but at least I can shout at someone direct ...Good luck 😀",2025-05-26T18:23:34.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

68301757f0e9f31c3b521224,Rog Yar,AU,2,1,Why TEMU Price Adjustment Isn't a Courtesy-It's a Control Tactic,"Have you noticed TEMU’s latest marketing tactic that seems designed to exploit customers? Here’s how it works: they initially overcharge for a product, then, after your order is placed and delivered, they offer a “Price Adjustment.” But there’s a catch: the refund isn’t returned to your original payment method. Instead, it’s issued as TEMU credit, effectively locking your money into their platform.This tactic subtly pressures customers to make another purchase, with a minimum spend of $40, just to use their credit. It’s a calculated way to retain customers without addressing product quality or service standards.Rather than focusing on genuine improvements, TEMU appears to be manipulating customer retention, hiding poor reviews, and profiting from a closed-loop credit system. When you raise concerns, they claim they want to “serve you again,” but in reality, they’ve created a system that forces you to return simply to recover money they refuse to refund properly.That’s not customer service. It’s manipulation, and for those fed up with low standards, it’s coercion. Walking away means saying goodbye to your credit, money TEMU gets to keep.",2025-05-24T12:15:50.000Z,,"Hi, Temu has established a minimum order value to enable us to provide a wider selection of lower-priced items to our customers, as the cost of shipping small orders is significantly higher.

Money will be refunded in 52 days. Seriously, this site is a complete con. If I want cheap tat in the future I'll go to Poundland. It's the same quality but the returns process is actually legal.In response to the message below, I have deleted my account and won't be returning.

5f1ad83602b0efdd1db0fe48,John,GB,8,1,"Buy cheap, Buy twice. You’ll never get a refund","Between TEMU and EVRI I’m never getting this refund. I sorted a return label for 10 items and dropped it off at the EVRI drop point on May 3rd. I’ve already left a review for EVRI, but TEMU haven’t been much better. Both are telling me the parcel is on its way, I know it’s not at the location anymore and I have no confirmation of collection either; so where is it!? TEMU customer service haven’t shed any light on my situation and if anything added to my frustration. Zero accountability, emotional intelligence or empathy what so ever. It’s been 3 weeks! TEMU said it’s not at the warehouse yet, but it’s been dropped off…I know that, I DROPPED IT OFF! The parcel is probably lost or stolen, that’s the only other avenues surely. I’ve been advised to go BACK to TEMU tomorrow for an update. All I want, is confirmation the parcel is going to be reviewed and refunds issued, or told it’s lost (by TEMU or EVRI) so I can try claim through my credit card provider. It’s an absolute shambles of a service by TEMU and their delivery partner EVRI. I want my refund, and thereafter will no long be using, or recommending TEMU ever again. Such a shame. *** TEMU, please reply with a better response than the ones I’ve seen on here, ie, sending me to the return/refund pages or speak to a live chat person.

I spent £11 on solar led lights only the first meter out of five worked. They offered a refund but turned out to be £3.86 and I don’t need to send it back. All I want is a replacement that worked. Will not be buying anything electrical from Temu again Temu have got back to me saying if I go to my app I can get a full refund. I go to my order and can no longer pick the item for a full refund as I have already had a refund of £3.86 which is not the £11.00 I payed. Temu have not replied or tried to contact me about a FULL refund. At least with UK sellers you get a warranty. Turns out not to be a cheap as you think if the item is faulty.

682cc19a4e662d0a1d1ce348,Wasim Akram,SA,3,1,Formal Dispute and Request for Clarification Regarding Return Under Tracking #404388256269,"Temu Customer Service,I am formally dispute the handling of my recent return associated with tracking number 404388256269, and to request a detailed explanation regarding six additional items that you claim were received under this return but allegedly belong to another account.1. All Items Were Returned TogetherI returned a total of seven (7) items in one sealed parcel, using the return label and tracking number provided by Temu. The parcel, measuring 380mm x 470mm and weighing 1.70 kg, was shipped and delivered successfully. The tracking information confirms that the parcel was received by Temu.2. Acknowledgment of Six Extra ItemsYour team has acknowledged receiving six additional items in the same parcel but claims they are associated with another account. This assertion is not only improbable but unfounded, as the parcel was sealed by me and contained only the items I originally purchased and intended to return. It is unreasonable to suggest that items from another account could have been included without explanation.3. Lack of Logical ExplanationIf these six items do not belong to me, then the following critical questions must be addressed: • Why were these items received and processed under my tracking number? • Why were they accepted into your return system without being flagged at the time of receipt? • On what basis does Temu assert that these items belong to another customer without providing supporting evidence?4. Request for EvidenceTo resolve this matter transparently, I request the following: • A complete list of the six items you claim are from another account. • Concrete evidence proving these items were not included in my original order or return. • Any internal documentation, tracking logs, or audit trails linking these six items to a different account.5. Request for Immediate RefundGiven that: • I returned all seven of my items in a single, sealed parcel using the provided return label, • The parcel was delivered and received under the specified tracking number, • There is no presented evidence of any error or wrongdoing on my part,I am formally requesting a full refund for all seven items returned. The alleged presence of additional items should not delay or invalidate my refund, particularly in the absence of clear proof that the error originated from my side.",2025-05-23T09:26:08.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

671b7ec5edd214acb371a863,Chris Mitchell,GB,2,1,Temu and the mysterious case of the disappearing promotion.,"I'll be saying nothing that hasn't been said before in other reviews with regard to Temu promotions, however I believe it is important to continue to highlight the issue in the hope that Temu will eventually realise the level of customer dissatisfaction this causes and revise their practices accordingly. In essence, Temu applies money off promotions to customer accounts, and when the customer proceeds to checkout expecting the relevant discount to be deducted, the offer disappears without warning and checkout displays the full price again with no discount. This was the case again for me today (£7 off a £7.01+ shop), and is just one of many such occurrences on my account. Customer service agents will claim that the promotions are time limited and will have expired when payment is attempted, however there is never any on screen indication of this to customers. Apart from these so called ""promotions"" being entirely misleading, not to mention unethical, customers can waste an inordinate amount of time choosing items to purchase to take advantage of the offer, only to be disappointed when it is inexplicably withdrawn. Interestingly, these particular promotions never seem to feature in the Expired Offers on customers' accounts, leading to suspicion that, in reality, they never actually existed in the first place and are simply a means of attempting to generate additional sales.",2025-05-23T00:07:05.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out, and we apologize that you are experiencing issues with our promotions.

682e7fa02f2478a0ecfb93fa,Ennise Williams,US,1,1,WARNING! Do NOT Buy from Temu!!,"WARNING!! Do NOT buy from Temu!! This item quality is TRASH!! And now Temu is BLATANTLY committing fraud by refusing to refund my order of $103.49 for two items I returned securely via the UPS QR Code they gave me for the return. I even have the receipt to prove the return was received by UPS and both items were sent inside of the same package. Temu waited a bit of time and then sent me a note buried inside of the app saying they declined the return. They gave 2 totally different reasons: 1) because the warehouse can’t find the items, so they can’t give me a refund. OR 2) they say the package the warehouse received was empty. Which makes ZERO sense, since UPS would not accept and give me a receipt for an empty package!! I spent over ONE HOUR on chat with customer service. And all they did was keep passing me around to 3 different departments who kept writing the same pre-written excuse with the 2 different ridiculous stories (wAREHOUSE can’t find the package or the package was empty when the WAREHOUSE received it.)I pointed out to them that I should not be penalized for what happens in their warehouse after they legitimately received the package through UPS, which is a reputable source. I also pointed out that maybe their warehouse staff stole the contents of the package?! I have demanded a refund but they continue to ignore me. I have been a loyal customer for a long time, but this is inexcusable and I want to warn people to NEVER shop with them again unless you want to be ripped off.My guess is that since the packages might be sent from China, now that they have new tariffs in place — Temu simply doesn’t want to bother to ship the returned packages back, so they want to blame the customers by claiming that the packages weren’t received or were empty?!I wish I could give Temu ZERO stars…but the minimum allowed was 1 star.",2025-05-22T03:36:40.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

It really annoyed me because I bought 2 to stack on top of eachother. Then the worst part was the top shelf had a piece of wood covering half of the opening. I thought that it would be ok because I could just put slippers in it. Nope couldnt even get a pair of flat slippers in it.

I was even contacted by Temu to give newspaper interviews, which I did not accept, not because I didn't believe in Temu but because the bad press, that could turn against me! Glad I didn't agree to defend them!!!! They have now shown their true colours for the sake a few pounds. Before there were times when I was begging to send the items back, but no, I would just get a refund and would have to give them again, now something is faulty I am treated in this way??? NO!I ordered a few things and sent back one pair of sunglasses I didn't feel had enough quality. Took a neck cushion on holidays, seemed OK, when I got back the foam had deteriorated or something and I had neck pain, so I talked to Temu about sending it back. They wanted postage costs for the first time. I pointed out that the items was faulty! They would hear. Contacted the next day again, received a return label, no talk about postage costs. I didn't trust it so before I sent it back I insisted on knowing if I would have to pay anything, told that if the item passed inspection then I would get my money. Now saw that they deducted the postage costs, so I didn't have the opportunity to say no and give the item away. If there is no assurance they deal with problems no one should buy with this company! They are now in the UK, but they won't give me the details of where I can complain, which by law they have to! I had seen quite a lot of reviews on their website of people complaining of the same problems, but it had never happened to me, now I am a victim too. Talked to a friend who also buys from Temu regularly, she is still treated well and her concerns still heard. Something is very wrong with this company. Also the costumer service, before very polite and willing to solve problems, no more! This could have happened because I was truthful in my reviews and even if they gave my money back I would tell the truth about the item. Disgraceful! UPDATE: Temu has now given my money back! Now I have to clarify whether one has any protection in case something goes wrong within reasonable time. So, I will be back shopping with Temu, but keeping my eyes wide open, and if things go wrong again, that will be the end of the road for me, which is sad.... before I honestly loved Temu!!!",2025-05-24T17:29:41.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out and we are sorry that you are not satisfied with your items.

Yet they have sent items with Evri again and guess what: Order placed at midday on 18/05/25 has NOT even arrived at a Chinese airport let alone arrive at my address in 4 working days, as they promise on their adverts. Pathetic, losers and good for nothing. I will not make further complaint as it falls on deaf ears. Right now I am chatting to someone, ostensibly called Clementine Campbell who does not know what to do!My current experience is ongoing right now. I wish I could share my chat here….their last message to me is as follows:Please kindly don't worry, I see that you already have a ticket for this issue on this ticket ID 1747800986210312 that being under further verification to my higher teams upon the refund ticket and I do badly wish I can do or process it for your request directly, it sadden me to hear that you are encountered this matter as I will be feel the same way if this matter happen to me.

682b8d504db5a066fffe3447,SJ,GB,3,1,Absolutely Appalling Delivery Experience via Temu/Yodel - A Full Day Wasted and Now Inconveniencing Others,"My order from Temu, which was entrusted to Yodel for delivery, has resulted in an absolutely appalling experience. Today was supposed to be a straightforward delivery between 14:59 and 16:59. Like many, I had to rearrange my work schedule to ensure I was home during this window – a sacrifice that has now proven to be a complete waste of my time, thanks to the poor delivery service.As I write this at 20:59, my parcel has still not arrived. Despite contacting Yodel's online chat facility (Temu's chosen courier), I was simply told to wait as the driver was supposedly in my area. This contradicted the tracking information, which clearly showed the driver moving further away from my location for the past three hours since 14:05 this afternoon. It's unacceptable that Temu would partner with a courier that provides such inaccurate information.The incompetence is staggering and reflects poorly on Temu's choice of delivery partner. Not only has Yodel, on behalf of Temu, wasted my entire afternoon and evening, but now I am forced to inconvenience a friend or family member by asking them to stay at my property tomorrow so I don't have to take another day off work. This disruption to my life is a direct consequence of the unreliable delivery service arranged by Temu.It's a stark contrast to how customers are treated. If I were to miss a payment to Temu, I'm sure consequences would follow. Yet, when their chosen courier completely disregards my time and disrupts my entire day, the expectation seems to be that I should simply accept it. This reflects poorly on Temu's customer service standards if they condone such poor delivery practices.I will update this review tomorrow to reflect how Yodel, on behalf of Temu, handles this situation and what new excuses they conjure up. As it stands, this entire delivery experience through Temu and their chosen courier has been nothing short of a complete and utter failure. Temu needs to seriously reconsider their delivery partnerships if they value customer satisfaction. Avoid ordering if you value your time and require reliable delivery.",2025-05-19T22:08:34.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us. We are sorry for any inconvenience caused.

My delivery info is correct as it appears on the site. No excuses for failed delivery twice. The first time the delivery company claimed I requested another delivery date. I did NOT. I found that notification on the TEMU site and was stunned. Finally, TEMU agreed to the refund but made me feel like they are doing me a one-time big favor. So, now I know I can't trust TEMU to refund my money to my bank if another package fails. Why should I buy more when I didn't get one package??? What is my guarantee that the next package will arrive? I feel like because I've always been fair when there is an understandable delivery problem, - patient and understanding, I was taken for a fool. Nice people are not fools. We are nice by choice.

When it eventually arrived it was absolute rubbish. I was able to return it for a refund. However because everything comes from China, the delivery times are very long. When I saw that Temu now have warehouses in the UK, I thought I’d give it another go. However the bedspread I have ordered took at least a week before even being posted and is now stuck at some airport before being delivered to Evri who will eventually deliver to me. Hopefully the bedspread when I get it will be satisfactory, otherwise it will have to be returned, yet again.Thanks for your reply. That still doesn’t change the fact that your delivery times are extremely long because everything comes from China.🇨🇳 I have now returned the bedspread which isn’t anything like the photograph in the advert and very thin and overpriced. Now I’m being bombarded with “ incentives” rather than being refunded to my PayPal account. All I now want is my refund asap. Temu say they will only refund once they receive it in good condition.

They are damaged massively by the inappropriateness of how Temu have packed them. An orange plastic bag that has fragile items in it. How on earth are those items, packed in this way going to make it from a factory in China, going on a plane and then through a courier process ever going to be delivered in one piece! Purchased party items where light up letters are chipped and broken, a slit in the bag where 2 items must have fallen out as they aren’t included, metal drink holders massively dented so un-useable. All in my opinion, avoidable by packing in a box. 100% would have made it to me in one piece if arrived in box. The exact same thing happened on my initial order. And I can see in these comments loads of comments about damaged items. So I leave this feedback in the hope they change this going forward. In all honesty the prices are cheap and I expect to be happy with some pieces and others not so, it’s the gamble of purchasing from these low priced sites. But I don’t get packing them in a way they are never ever going to make it to you in one piece. So with the party being a week away I can’t reorder damaged / missing items and guarantee getting in time. So disappointed when it’s in Temus control.

I had order just around £150 of goods 02.05.25. The app stated to expect delivery between 12.5.35 to 16.5.25. I waited but did not receive anything. Checked neighbour nothing. Finally made an enquiry with Temu for non receipt was sent a picture showing my packages in a recycling bin for which collection was Friday. I was horrified by what i discovered. I have not used recycling for ages but my neighbours do and uses the same boxes for rubbish. My packages was left on an insecure expose place at the front of the property in the open shallow recycling rubbish box. I had not receive notification of where it was left only on the app stating it was delivered but not me. Just left on open ground. Who would want anything delivered bythis method. I would never and did not instruct my packages to be left in this manner. Its totally unsafe. This is outrageous and callous. I've advised my whole family and friends not yo use the services as it's like throwing your hard earned money away. I've told my sister to cancel her recent order as she's unlikely yo get it in such a gamble to deliver. There no point. Temu don't deserve any points for the delivery services they provide.

5f33dab5335acc4a4f9642da,- Domingos Melo,PT,5,2,Discrepancies between TEMU Application and Site - Chat doesn't help,"I’ve been a long-time customer, and while some of your products have met my expectations, the overall customer support experience has been disappointing. Whenever I encounter an issue and attempt to use the chat service for clarification, it typically proves unhelpful. Although the representatives are polite, my questions often go unanswered.My most recent concern, as of May 16, 2025, is the inconsistency between your advertisements and the actual availability of products and offers. For example, I saw a compact dishwasher promoted on Facebook, but I’ve been unable to find it either on your website or in the app. Similarly, the app mentions a €200 credit, yet there’s no clear information about this promotion anywhere. This lack of transparency is frustrating and undermines trust in your advertising.It was evident that the chat support could neither resolve my issue nor locate the product in question.TEMU does offer some good products. However, when it comes to addressing concerns or seeking direct explanations, the chat service is usually ineffective. Additionally, promotional offers seen on social media are difficult—if not impossible—to locate within the app or on the TEMU website. Reaching out via chat for assistance in these matters feels like a waste of time.This is my analysis.",2025-05-16T12:30:37.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.

68270fd375d981264c8a1212,Blanaid Lawson,GB,1,5,Amazing Experiences,I have bought hundreds of items at incredible prices. I have only had a problem with two items and the complaints process has been efficient and courteous. All items have that have not arrived in time (very few) have been given a credit. The communication at every part of the ordering process is sublime and updates are regular and accurate. You might have to wait a little longer than other sites but they are coming a long way and patience is a virtue.,2025-05-16T12:14:01.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for shopping with us and sharing your 5-star experience!

58f689100000ff000a8e7c1b,Pauline,GB,42,1,Bad delivery,"Absolute nightmare with delivery and customer service and seller response is not satisfactory you have to wait at least 24 hours for seller to respond and Customer service is even worse 72 hours the whole process is a joke. My recommendation is if your going to use a company like this use SHEIN there delivery service is second to none you are kept updated every step of the way, unlike Temu this relating to the delivery and returns of large pieces of furniture so my experience is not positive just received the standard robotic message about how important customers are if we are that important you would address all the issues in my review.",2025-05-16T11:39:29.000Z,,"Hello, thank you for reaching out to us.
