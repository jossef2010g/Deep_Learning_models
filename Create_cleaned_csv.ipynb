I returned two packages to Temu via DHL on 02.06.2025. However, Temu claims they only received one package. DHL confirmed that both returns were sent under the same tracking number (00340434640263183760). DHL also informed me that only Temu, as the contractual partner, can initiate an official investigation, but Temu refuses to cooperate and is ignoring my requests. I have lost 25.59 euros because of this issue and have received no resolution from Temu despite repeated attempts to resolve the matter. I strongly advise others to be cautious when dealing with Temuâ€™s return process.  2025-07-07T09:55:15.000Z                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

Now I'm at the point I'm getting in touch with citizens advice to contact trade-in standards as a consumer act. Law says they are responsible to refund or reshare but they will not do anything at all about it. This has become an joke now I am sick of contacting them. All they do is open a ticket and then close it again. I have photographic evidence to prove I haven't got the parcel. Still refusing to do anything about it. How is this company still allowed to trade? All it does is rip people off all the time They're not interested in looking into anything. They just send generic messaging So tell you before you do your generic reply. I have contacted customer service but number of times and I'm talking in the high numbers and they still are refusing to do anything about it. So I am going to take this further. More people should be doing this and instead of letting this company carry on trading and taking people's money and not supplying itemsTemu as I said I have a lot of times you don't want to know.
